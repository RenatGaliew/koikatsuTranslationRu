「うん、やろうやろう！　私も頑張らないかんなーって思いよったっちゃん」=Yeah, let's do it! I was in just the mood to get some cramming in myself.
「良かった。俺もだよ。一人だと集中出来なくて……」=Great. Same here. I just can't seem to concentrate by myself...
「分かる分かる。何事も仲間が必要やもんね！　それじゃ、一緒に頑張ろう！」=I feel you. It's important to have comrades for anything and everything! Well then, let's work hard together!
