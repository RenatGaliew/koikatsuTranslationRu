「あ……もう終わりなの？　疲れてるのかしら……？　それとも……まさか浮気っ……なーんて♪　男の子は女子にそんなこと考えさせちゃダメよ？　次は頑張ってくれると嬉しいな」=Ah... Is it over already? Are you tired...? Or... Are you cheating...? Haha, Just kidding ♪ But, you know, Boys shouldn't make girls have those kinds of thoughts. If you were to hold on for longer next time, I'd be really happy~
