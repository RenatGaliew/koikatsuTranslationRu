「あら、揚げ物がたくさん……キミ、そんなに揚げ物好きなの？」=Oh, there's so much fried food... Hey, do you love fried food that much?
「あはは、そういうわけじゃないんだけど……これくらい食べておかないと午後にお腹減っちゃって……」=Ahaha, that's not exactly the case... It's just that if I don't eat at least this much then I get really hungry in the afternoon...
「ふふ、授業中にお腹がなったら恥ずかしいものね。でも、食べすぎには注意するのよ？」=Fufu, if your stomach were to rumble halfway through class, that would certainly be very embarrassing. But, you should be careful about not eating too much, alright?
「そうなのね」=You're right.
