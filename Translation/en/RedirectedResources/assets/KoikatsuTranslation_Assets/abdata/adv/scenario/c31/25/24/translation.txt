「お、探したぞ。見てくれ、モンブランを作ってみたんだっ。自信作だぞ♪」=Oh, I was looking for you. Look, I tried making some Mont Blancs! They're pretty good, if I do say so myself♪
「授業なのに真剣過ぎるとからかわれた位だ。おまえにやる事は最初からバレていたしな……」=They're so good, the others teased me for being too serious during Home Ec. They all knew I planned to give them to you from the start...
「というわけだから、感謝して食べるように！　ほら、彼女特製モンブランだぞっ♪」=That's why, eat them with gratitude! Come on, they're your girlfriend's specially made Mont Blancs!♪
