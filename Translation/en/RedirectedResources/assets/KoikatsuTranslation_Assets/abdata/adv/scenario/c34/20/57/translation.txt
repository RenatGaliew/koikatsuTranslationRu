「おお！　その服、可愛いね！　キュート！」=Ooh! Those clothes, they're really cute!
「アウゥ……ｃｕｔｅ，ｔｈａｎｋ　ｙｏｕ♡　スゴク迷う甲斐ありマシタ♡」=Auuu... thank you♡ It was worth it, to spend all that time, deciding on clothes.
（めちゃくちゃ緊張してる。可愛いなぁ）=(She's super nervous. So cute)
「ア、アナタも、ｃｈａｒｍｉｎｇネ♡　今日ハ、ドコ行くデスカ？」=Y-You too, you look super charming♡ Where are we going todayy?
「日本に帰ってきたばっかりの[H]に、街を案内しようと思ってたんだ。早速行こうよ」=Since you've just recently come back to Japan, I thought I'd show you around the city. Let's get to it.
「色々回ったけど、どうだった？」=We circled around a bunch, how was it?
「アノ……エト……ｓｏｒｒｙ！　アナタがｓｏ　ｃｏｏｌスギテ、内容、覚えてナイデス……」=Uhm... erhm... sorry! You were just so cool, I don't remember a thing about the area...
「えっ！？　く、クール？」=Eh--!? C-Cool?
「ワタシをｅｓｃｏｒｔシテくれるアナタ、ｓｔｙｌｉｓｈデ……ｔｉｍｅ　ｉｓ　ｍｏｎｅｙナノニ、ゴメンナサイ……」=You were so stylish, the way you were escorting me everywhere... I'm sorry, even though time is money...
「いや、日本に慣れてない上に緊張もしたら、訳分からなくなるよね。配慮が足りなくてごめんね」=No, on top of not being used to Japan, you were nervous too, obviously you'd feel like a fish out of water. I'm sorry for being so thoughtless.
「……アノ、怒ってナイデスカ？　セッカク、素敵ｐｌａｎ、考えてきてクレマシタノ二……」=...Uhm, are you not mad at me? Even though you went out of your way, to plan the entire thing out...
「あはは、むしろ俺なんかで周りが見えなくなるぐらい緊張してくれて嬉しいよ。とりあえず、喫茶店でお話して緊張をほぐそうか」=Ahaha, if anything, I'm really happy that you stressed out so much that you weren't able to keep track of our surroundings over someone like me. For the time being, let's loosen up at a cafe.
「Ｏｈ……♡　本物のｇｅｎｔｌｅｍａｎデース……♡」=Oh...♡ You really are a gentleman...♡
（目がハートになってる……緊張が解けた後、[H]に余裕があればもう一度街を回ろうかな）=(Her eyes are turning into hearts... After she settles down a bit, if she still has time, guess we'll make another round of the area)
「今日ハ、アナタの素敵なトコロ、イッパイ見れましタ♡　ワタシモ反省シテ、緊張気を付けマス！」=Today, I got to see lots of your wonderful sides♡ I'll reflect on it too, and try to be less nervous next time!
