「誰かと一緒にやると捗るわね。一気に復習しちゃったわ」=Work gets done really fast if you do it with someone else, doesn't it? I'm already done with my review
「俺もだよ。それに……なんだかすごく楽しかった」=Same here. It's not just that... I had a lot more fun than I would have if I did it by myself
「ふふっ、実はお姉さんも。勉強が楽しいって思うことなんて滅多にないのに……」=Fufu~ Same for me. It's not often I find studying to be fun.
「やっぱりキミと一緒だからかしら？」=In the end, I suppose it was because I did it together with you.
「照れくさいけど、そうだったら嬉しいな」=Hearing you say it like that is embarrasing, but it also makes me happy
