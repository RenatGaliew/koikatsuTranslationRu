「何頼むか考えてる時、メニューの成分表をじーっと見てたけど、何かアレルギーとかあったっけ？」=When you were thinking of what to order, you were staring real hard at the ingredients list for each item on the menu, do you have an allergy to something?
「Ａｌｌｅｒｇｙは大丈夫ダケド、ニッポンと海外でｃａｌｏｒｉｅトカ、ｃｈｏｌｅｓｔｅｒｏｌトカ、スゴク違うカラ、ｃｈｅｃｋしてたノ……♡」=Not allergies but, there's a big difference in Japanese food and western food, in terms of calories and cholesterol and stuff, so I was just checking that...♡
「えっ。もしかして、日頃からカロリー計算とか、栄養バランスを考えて食べてるの？」=Eh--. Do you like, count calories and try to balance your nutrition when eating?
「Ｙｅｓ♡　ダッテ、アナタはワタシのｓｌｅｎｄｅｒなカラダが好きデショ？　Ｂａｌａｎｃｅがダメだと、アナタがｕｎｈａｐｐｙなるカラ」=Yes♡ After all, you like my slender body, no? If there's an imbalance, it'll make you unhappy, that's why.
「俺の好みのためにそんなこと考えてくれてたなんて……俺も[H名]みたいに痩せた方がいいかな」=To think you were going out of your way for my sake... Maybe I should slim up a bit too, like you.
「Ｎｏ　ｐｒｏｂｌｅｍ♡　ワタシ、アナタがｓｌｅｎｄｅｒデモｆａｔデモ、ｐｈｅｒｏｍｏｎｅ感じる思うヨ♡」=It's not a problem♡ No matter whether you're slender or fat or in between, what I feel is your pheromones, your sex appeal♡
「ふぇ、フェロモン？」=P-Pheromones?
「Ｓｏ♡　ｐｈｅｒｏｍｏｎｅ♡　優しいナ～、カッコイイナ～、オトコノコダナ～、って思う時、ｐｈｅｒｏｍｏｎｅ感じるヨ♡　ダカラ、体型はアマリ関係ないカモ」=That's right♡ Pheromones♡ Everytime I think stuff like "You're so sweet~" or "So cool~" or "So manly~", I feel your pheromones♡ That's why, I don't think your figure matters.
「あ、ありがと。そんな大した男ではないと思うけど……」=T-Thanks. I don't think I'm all that special a man though...
「イエイエ♡　ワタシがｓｌｅｎｄｅｒナラ、アナタはｓｍａｒｔダヨ♡　自信を持ったオトコノコ、トテモ、カッコイイカラ、ワタシの言葉を信じてネ♡」=Not at all♡ If I'm slender, then you're smart and cool♡ Guys with self-confidence are super cool so, believe my words, okay?♡
「オッケー。言葉の壁のことをいつも考えてる[H名]に言われるなら、説得力あるし、信じるよ」=Gotcha. Since it's coming from you, someone who always thinks about the language barrier, it does have quite some persuasiveness to it, so I'll believe you.
「Ｏｆ　ｃｏｕｒｓｅ♡　今ヨリ太ったラ、アナタに嫌われちゃうカラ♡」=Of course♡ If I got any fatter, you'll fall out of love with me♡
「いや、そんな……たしかに今の[H名]の体型は好きだけど、そんなストイックにならなくても大丈夫だよ？」=No, that's... It's true that I like your figure as it is right now, [H名], but you don't need to force yourself like that, you know?
「アリガト♡　デモ、大好きなオトコノコのｆａｖｏｒｉｔｅに尽くすノ、『オトメゴコロ』ダカラ、Ｓｔｏｉｃと違うヨ♡　エット……ソウ、『自然体』ネ♡」=Thanks♡ But, working hard to become the image of their beloved's ideal is part of what every girl wants, so I'm not forcing myself♡ Rather, it's erhm... right, it's just natural♡
「そ、そっか、ならいいんだ。でも、[H名]みたいな魅力的な女の子に尽くされるほど、すごい男ではないと思うけど」=I-I see, in that case it's fine. But, I don't think I'm all that amazing a guy, to have a girl as charming as you work hard for my sake.
「フフ♡　ワタシにとってアナタはスゴイ男ダヨ？　ニッポンに帰って、ミギヒダリ不明なワタシに話しかけシテクレテ……」=Fufu♡ You are amazing to me, you know? You talked to me, someone who didn't know their left from right after coming back to Japan...
「ワタシは言葉も下手、考え方もニッポンのヒトと違うケド、アナタは受け入れてくれたヨネ♡　アナタの器、トテモｂｉｇでｄｅｅｐ♡　大好き♡」=I'm awkward with words, and my way of thinking isn't very Japanese, but you still accepted all of it♡ Your heart and ability, both are big and deep♡ I love you♡
「あ、あはは、照れさせてくれるなぁ……」=A-Ahaha, man, you're making me blush...
（何度も言ってくれるってことは、それだけ[H名]も気にかけてることなんだろうな。これからも[H名]が思ってくれてるような男でありたいな）=(The fact that she's said it that many times just goes to show how much [H名] thinks of me. From now on, I want to be even more of the sort of man she sees me as.)
