「やった、今日の日替わりは唐揚げだ」=“Today I decided to change and brought fried food.”
「えー、唐揚げの日って……女子だと逆に人気がない方なんだけどな」=“Eh～ Fried food today... it's not very popular among girls, though...”
「そうなの？　美味しいのに？」=“Is that so? Even though it's delicious?”
「味じゃなくてカロリーの問題だよー。美味しいのは……分かってるんだよ……うぅ……」=“The problem isn't the taste, but the calories～ It's delicious... I know that... uu...”
「もう、そんな辛そうに我慢しなくても……一つあげよっか？」=“Jeez, you're being harsh on yourself... would you like a bite?”
「はぅっ！？　う……ぅ……はぅ……く……ぅ……お……お願いします……」=“Haa!? Uu... ha... ku... p... please...”
「あ、ははは……すごい葛藤だったね」=“Ah, hahaha... you looked really conflicted.”
