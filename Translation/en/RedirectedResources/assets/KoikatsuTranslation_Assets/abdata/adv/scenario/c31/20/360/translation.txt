「うぅ、今更ながら自己嫌悪だ……こんな所で、こんな事を……」=Uuu, I know it's too late to say this but, I hate myself... Doing this sort of thing, in a place like this...
「そう？　俺はドキドキして気持ち良かったけどな」=That so? For me, it felt very nice and exciting.
「はぁ、何故エッチの時だけはそう大胆になるんだ？　性欲だけで生きているのか？」=Haa, why is that that you're so bold only when it comes to sex? Do you live off of lust alone?
「はは……実際そうかも……」=Haha... that might be true...
「あながち冗談とも言い切れないのが嫌だな……まぁいい、きちんと掃除してから帰るぞ」=What I hate the most is that I can't even pass it off as a joke... Well, whatever, we're going home after cleaning up.
「了解です！　塵一つ残さず綺麗にします！　サー！」=Understood! I'll make sure to make it spotless! Here I go!
