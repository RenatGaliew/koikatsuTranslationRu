「素敵なお部屋ね～。二人で楽しい時間が過ごせそう」=“What a lovely little room~. We could have such a nice fun time in here.”
「はは、カラオケ、あまりこないの？」=“Haha, don't come to Karaoke often?”
「ううん、歌うのは大好きよ。みんなで元気を分けあう感じがいいのよね」=“I do, I love singing. Sharing the excitement with everyone feels great, doesn't it?”
「友達、多そうだもんね」=“You do seem like the sort to have lots of friends.”
「そんなことないわよ。最近、付き合いが良くないって言われてるし」=“Not at all. Recently, people have been telling me that I'm no fun to hang out with anymore.”
「え？　どうして？」=“Eh? Why?”
「んー、今、ちょっと手のかかる子がいるの。ちょっと変わった子で、まだ少し学園に馴染んでないみたいで……目が離せないの」=“Nnn, there's this little baby I have my hands full with, right now. A pretty odd guy, seems he hasn't gotten all that settled into his new school just yet so... I can't take my eyes off him.”
「へー……そんなヤツがいるんだね」=“Hoh... a guy like that exists, huh?”
「……ふふふ、本当に変わった子ね、あなたって」=“...Fufufu, you're really just such an odd guy.”
「あ……俺のことだったの？」=“Ah... were you talking about me?”
「そうそう、そういうところが変わってて面白いの」=“That's exactly the odd side I was talking about, it's really interesting.”
「はは、なんだか照れちゃうな……」=“Haha, now you're making me blush...”
「ふふ、さて……と。そろそろ何か歌いましょう？　あ、そうそう喉乾いてる？　ここソフトドリンク飲み放題よ」=“Fufu, now then... Shall we get to singing? Ah, you're not thirsty, are you? This place has an all-you-can-drink system here.”
「あ、うん、そうだね」=“Ah, yeah, right.”
「お腹は空いてない？　トイレは大丈夫？　私、付き添ってあげましょうか？」=“Hungry at all? Need to go to the restroom? Want me to take you there?”
「ははは、大丈夫だっては。それより、曲を入れなきゃ。お先どうぞ」=“Hahaha, I'm fine, seriously. Rather than that, we gotta pick a song. You can go first.”
「そう？　じゃ、最初はこの曲からね」=“You sure? Then, I'll start off with this.”
『もしも今 背中に羽が生えて 大空自由に 飛び回れたら～♪』=『If only I could, sprout wings from my back, and fly freely, in this wide open sky~♪』
「へー……上手上手ー♪」=“Hoh... you're so good♪”
