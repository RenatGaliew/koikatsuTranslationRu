「うふふ、今日を楽しみにしてたわ」=“Ufufu, I was really excited for today.”
「俺もだよ。楽しみすぎて、昨日はあんまり眠れなかったんだ」=“Me too. So excited, I couldn't sleep all that much last night.”
「嬉しいわ～。それじゃあ、さっそく行きましょうか」=“That makes me so happy~. Well then, let's go.”
「見て見て～、あの服、あなたに似合いそうだわ。あっ、あっちも素敵！　迷っちゃうわね～」=“Look, look~, those clothes, they'd look so good on you. Ah--, those are lovely too! I can't decide~”
「俺のじゃなくて、君の好きな店に行っていいんだよ？」=“We can go somewhere more to your liking instead, you know?”
「ありがとう。でも私はあなたのものを見てる方が楽しいの♪　ね、試着してみてくれる？」=“Thank you. But picking out clothes for you is more fun for me♪ Hey, will you try them on?”
「う、うん……君がそれでいいなら……」=“S-Sure... if you're happy with that...”
「あぁん、もうバイバイしなきゃダメなの？　残念ね……。でも今日は楽しかったわ。ありがとう。それじゃあね」=“Aahn, do we have to say goodbye already? Shame... But I had a lot of fun today. Thank you. See you~.”
