「電車に乗ると、現実にぐっと引き戻された気がするな」=“Getting on the train really has a way of pulling you straight back to reality, doesn't it?”
「ですね……また不幸に見舞われる日々に戻ってしまう……」=“It does... I'll have to return back to my everyday life, a life surrounded by misfortune...”
「日常に戻っても、一緒に不幸を忘れるくらい楽しく過ごせば大丈夫さ」=“Even if you do, as long as we have enough fun together to offset that misfortune, it'll be just fine.”
「はいっ」=“Yes--”
