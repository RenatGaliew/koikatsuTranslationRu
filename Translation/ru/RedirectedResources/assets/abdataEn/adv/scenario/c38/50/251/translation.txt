（いやー、やっぱり遊園地デートは王道だよね。何を思い出してもニヤけちゃうよ……）=(Man, you really can't go wrong with an amusement park date. No matter what I think back to, all of it was lovey-dovey...)
（特に観覧車……よかったなぁ……[H名]が可愛すぎて、もう死んでもいいと思ったね）=(Especially that ferris wheel ride at the end... it was so nice... [H名] was being so cute, I think I could have died happy then and there.)
（次はどんなデートがいいかなぁ……何しても楽しそうで、逆に悩むなぁ……）=(Where should we go next time... I feel like we'd have fun just about anywhere, so if anything, that's making it harder to pick...)
