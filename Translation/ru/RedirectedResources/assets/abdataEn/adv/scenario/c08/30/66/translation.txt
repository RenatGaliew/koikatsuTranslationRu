「ねえ、あの雲とあの雲だったら、どっちが好み？」=“Hey, between that cloud and that one over there, which one do you like better?”
「ん～……あの雲は足が速そうだから好き。あの雲は頭が良さそうだから好き」=“Nn~... that cloud looks like it has fast legs, so I like it. That one looks like it's got a pretty good head, so I like it too.”
「えっと、つまりどっちなんだい？」=“Erhm, so which is it?”
「どっちも好きなんだよ」=“I like them both.”
「なるほど。聞いといてなんだけど、違いが良く分からない！」=“I see. I was the one who asked but, I don't really get it!”
