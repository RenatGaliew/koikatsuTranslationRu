「あっ……」=“Ah--...”
「どうかしたの？」=“What's the matter?”
「いや、何かお土産を買っとけばよかったかなって。お揃いのキーホルダーとか」=“Nothing, I was just thinking that maybe it would have been nice to buy some sort of souvenirs, like matching keychains or whatever.”
「今日の記念になるだろ？」=“Would have been something to remember the day by, no?”
「う～ん、そういう形に残るものもいいけど……素敵な思い出をたくさん貰ったから大丈夫だよ♪」=“Mmm~, something like that might have been nice but... we made tons of wonderful memories instead, so I think it's fine♪”
