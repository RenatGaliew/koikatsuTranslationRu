「えっ……冗談……よね？　私が何かしたなら謝るし直すわ」=“Ah... it's a joke... right? If I did something wrong, I apologize and I'll fix it.”
「えっと、ごめん……」=“Um, sorry...”
「ごめんって何よ。あなたが何か悪いことでもしたの？　違うでしょ。どうして……」=“Sorry for what? Did you do something wrong? That's not true. Why...”
「……本当にごめん」=“...I'm really sorry.”
「……そう、私じゃダメだったのね。っ……今までありがとう。さようなら」=“...I see, so I wasn't good enough... Thank you for everything until now. Goodbye.”
