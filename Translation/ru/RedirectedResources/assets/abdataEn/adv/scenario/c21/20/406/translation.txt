「――で？　その後、どうなったの？」=“--And then? What happened after?”
「うん、それで……って、だんだん混んできたね、今何時だろ……わっ！　もうこんな時間っ？」=“Yeah, so... wuh, it's starting to pretty packed here, isn't it? What time is it... wah--! It's already this late--?”
「うわ、本当だ。まだ一時間ぐらいしか喋ってないと思ってたよ」=“Uwah, you're right. I really thought we'd only been talking for like an hour.”
「私もー……えへへ、時間を忘れるぐらい話し込んじゃうとか、私たち仲良しだね」=“Me too~... Eheheh, we're really intimate, aren't we? Chatting so much that we forgot the time~”
「あはは、本当にね。話題も尽きないし、幼馴染みじゃないのが不思議なくらいだよ」=“Ahahah, really. We never run out of things to talk about either, you'd think we were childhood friends or something.”
「もしかしたら前世で幼馴染みだったのかも、なーんて」=“We might have been, in our previous lives. Heh.”
「もしそうでも俺は驚かないよ、フィーリングばっちりすぎだし……あ、今入ってきた人でちょうど満席だね。出ようか」=“I wouldn't be surprised if we were. The feeling's just too perfect for that... ah, those people just took the last empty table. We should head out and make space.”
（喫茶店でずっと話してただけだったけど、充実した時間だったなぁ……）=(We ended up just chatting all day but, what a good day it was~...)
