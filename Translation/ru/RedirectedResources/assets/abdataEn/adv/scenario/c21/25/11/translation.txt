「ねえ、キミが私のこと好きなのかもうわかんないよ。もう話したくない」=“Hey, I can't tell at all anymore, if you still love me. I don't want to talk any more.”
「え……」=“Eh...”
「ごめんね。私の心が狭いのかな。男の子のこと理解できてないのかな」=“I'm sorry. Maybe I'm just too narrow minded. Or maybe I just don't get guys.”
「ちょ、ちょっと待って」=“W-Wait a sec.”
「勝手なことばっかり言ってごめんね。もう、話しかけないで。バイバイ」=“Sorry for being so selfish. Don't come talk to me anymore. Byebye.”
