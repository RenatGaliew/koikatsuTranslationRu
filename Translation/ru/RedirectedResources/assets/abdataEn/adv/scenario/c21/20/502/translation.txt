「[H名]、おはよう！」=“Morning, [H名]!”
「おはよ～♪　今日はどこに行くの？　お任せでいいのかな？」=“Morning~♪ Where are we going today? Do you mind if I leave it all to you?”
「うん、もちろん。あ、でも[H名]の希望があるなら言ってね。俺のプランより、そっちが優先だからさ」=“Yep, not at all. Ah, but if there's something you wanna do, you just let me know, okay? My plan is nowhere near as important as you.”
