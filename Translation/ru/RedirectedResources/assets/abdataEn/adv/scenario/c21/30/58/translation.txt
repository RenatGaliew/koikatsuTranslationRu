「いきなりですが問題です。今日の私は普段の私とどこが違うでしょうか？」=“Sudden though it may be, but I have a question for you, mister. In what way do I differ today, from my usual self?”
「お…じゃあ、デート中に全部当ててみせるよ」=“Oh... don't you worry, I'll guess every single thing one by one today as we're going along.”
「あ、このクレープ美味しいな」=“Ah, this crepe's damn good.”
「でしょ！？　私のおススメなんだ～！　こっちの味も食べてみて♪」=“Isn't it though!? I always recommend it to people~! Try this too♪”
