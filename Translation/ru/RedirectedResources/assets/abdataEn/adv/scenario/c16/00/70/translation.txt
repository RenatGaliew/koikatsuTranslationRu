「ねぇ、ここわかる？　これって絶対、問題がおかしいわよね？」=“Hey, you get this one? It's not me, is it? Surely this question's just broken?”
「あ、それね。この前先生に聞いたら……って、ち、近いよ？　皆見てるから……」=“Ah, that one. I asked the teacher last time and... wuh, y-you're pretty close, you know? Everyone's looking...”
「えっ？　あっ！　ご、ごめんなさい！　私……つい夢中になって……うぅ、ほんとに、ごめんね」=“Eh--? Ah--! I-I'm sorry! I... always get lost in things... uuu, I really am sorry.”
「はは、そんなに謝らなくていいって。皆もきみが真面目なの知ってるしさ。大丈夫だよ」=“Hahah, you don't need to apologize that much. Everyone knows you're just serious about this stuff too. So don't worry.”
