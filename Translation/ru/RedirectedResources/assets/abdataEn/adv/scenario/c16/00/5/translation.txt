「良い汗って……また変わった誘い方ね」=“Work up some sweat... you sure know how to come up with weird ways of asking things, everytime.”
「はは、ありきたりじゃ何かダメかなって」=“Hahah, I thought it would have been boring if I just asked normally.”
「いいわ。少しでも私に合わせようとしてくれたという事でしょう？　なら悪い気はしないし」=“It's fine. You did it that way because you thought I'd like it, no? So I can't really take it badly either.”
