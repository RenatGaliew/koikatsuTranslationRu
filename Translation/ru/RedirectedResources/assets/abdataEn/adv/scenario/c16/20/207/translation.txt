「夜景、本当に綺麗だったわね。これなら何度でも見たくなるわ」=“The view was really pretty, wasn't it? Can't help but wanna see it again and again when something's that pretty.”
「見たくなったら、また来ようよ。何度だって付き合うからさ」=“If you do, let's come here again. I'll take you here as many times as you want.”
「ありがとう。それじゃあ今日は、そろそろ帰らないとかしら」=“Thanks. Well then, I suppose we have to head home now, for today.”
「うん、最後に観覧車も乗れたし、今日はもう思い残す事はないかな」=“Yep, we even rode the ferris wheel so, I don't think there's anything else left for us to do.”
「そうね、もう周りの人もまばらだし、堂々と手を繋いで帰りましょう」=“Yeah, there's barely anyone left out on the streets too, let's hold hands while we walk.”
