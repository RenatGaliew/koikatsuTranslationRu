「へぇ、思い切ったわね。何か勝算が？」=“Hoh, that's bold of you. What makes you think you have a chance?”
「特にないよ。強いていうなら勢いかな」=“Nothing in particular. If I had to say, I thought my energy would get through to you.”
「プッ、何よそれ……でも気に入ったわ。予定を決めましょ」=“Pfft--, what's with that... but I don't hate that. Let's decide on the plan.”
