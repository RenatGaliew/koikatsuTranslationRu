「気にしてないよ。なんか待ってる時間も幸せでさ」=“I don't mind it. Just waiting for you makes me happy too.”
「そ、そう……ならよかっ……うーん、よくはない……わよね？　待たせた事には変わりないんだし」=“I-I see... that's goo--... nnn, it's still not good... is it? It doesn't change the fact that I made you wait.”
「ははっ、難しく考え過ぎだよ。さ、帰ろっか」=“Hahah--, you're thinking too much. Come on, let's go home.”
