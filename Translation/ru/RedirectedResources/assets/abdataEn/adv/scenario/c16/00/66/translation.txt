「いいよ。どこの店？」=“Sure. What shop is it?”
「ん？　普通の本屋さんよ。そうそう、昨日の新刊でアナタにオススメの本があったのよ」=“Nn? Just a regular bookstore. Right, there was a book on the new releases list yesterday, that I'd recommend for you.”
「へぇ、どんなの？」=“Hoh, what sort?”
「経営学の本なんだけどね、読んでおいて損はないから。フフッ、きっと気に入ると思うの♪」=“It's a book on business administration but, it's not like you'll lose anything by reading it. Fufuh--, I'm sure you'll like it♪”
