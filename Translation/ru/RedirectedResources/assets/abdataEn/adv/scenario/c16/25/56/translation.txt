「ねぇ、私の何が悪かったの？　私、これでも一生懸命やってきたつもりよ！」=“Hey, just what didn't you like? It may not have looked like it, but I've been putting my all into this!”
「わかってる……感謝もしてるよ。でも、もう無理なんだ」=“I get that... and I'm grateful. But, I can't do it anymore.”
「ふっ……ふふっ……何よそれ……あーあ、何なのよもう……私……バカみたい」=“Fuh--... fufuh--... what the heck is that... aaaah, just what the heck... I... I feel like an idiot.”
「…………ごめん」=“...Sorry.”
「謝らないで！　結局、私が何もわかっていなかっただけでしょう？　もういいわ、さようなら」=“Don't apologize! In the end, I was the one who didn't understand anything, no? It's fine, goodbye.”
