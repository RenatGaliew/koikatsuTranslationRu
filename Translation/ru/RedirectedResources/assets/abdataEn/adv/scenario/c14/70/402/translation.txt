「おっ！　これ、今話題のやつじゃねえの？」=“Oh--! Isn't this that 'in' thing?”
「ん？　何のこと？」=“Nn? What are you talking about?”
「ほら、店の中で流れてる曲の話だよ」=“I'm talking about the song that's playing, in the store.”
「この曲、今流行りの映画の曲だろ？　ＣＭとかで聞かねえか？」=“This song, it's from that really popular movie, no? Ain't heard it yet? In a TV ad or whatever?”
「う～ん、知らないなあ。なんて映画？」=“Mmm, can't say I have. What movie?”
「あれだよ。子ども向け映画の……」=“That one. The one aimed at kids...”
「ああ、あの映画か」=“Aah, that movie, huh?”
「でも、タイトルは聞いたことあるけど、さすがに主題歌までは知らなかったなぁ」=“I've heard the name before but, can't say I knew the song at all.”
「そうなのか？　結構泣ける映画だから、お前も一度見ておいたほうがいいぜ！」=“That so? It's quite the emotional movie so, you should try watching it yourself, one of these days!”
「え……でも、子ども向けの映画なんでしょ？　見る気になれないな……なもしかして[H名]、見に行ったの？」=“Eh... but, it's a kids' movie, no? Can't really bring myself to watch one of those... did you actually go watch it in a theatre, [H名]?”
「み、見てちゃわりぃのかよぉ！」=“W-What's wrong with that?!”
「知り合いに勧められて……別に、見に行きたくて行ったわけじゃねーから！」=“A friend recommended it to me... it's not, it's not like I went to watch it on my own!”
「その割には、かなり褒めてたよね」=“Considering that, you were sure singing its praises.”
「うるせえ！　ああ～もう、この話はやめだ！　聞かなかったことにしてくれ！」=“Shaddup! Aah~, jeez, no more of that! Pretend you never heard that!”
「ふふ……じゃあよかったら、今度一緒に見に行こうね」=“Fufu... in that case, let's go watch it together one of these days, okay?”
「……まあ、考えといてやるよ」=“...Well, I'll think about it.”
