「えぇ、そんなこと思ってたの！？」=“Eeh, did you really!?”

「今日は本当にありがとな。その……ホント楽しかったよ。」=“Thanks for today, really. It uhm... it really was a blast.”
CHOICE:「俺も楽しかったよ……もうちょっと一緒にいない？」=I had a blast too. ...won't you stay with me for a bit longer?
CHOICE:「こちらこそありがとう。じゃあまた学園で！」=No, I should be saying that. Thank you. See ya at school then!
「俺も楽しかったよ。……もうちょっと一緒にいない？」=“I had a blast too. ...won't you stay with me for a bit longer?”
