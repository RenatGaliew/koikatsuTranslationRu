「う～ん……なるほどなぁ……」=“Mmm... I see...”
「メニューを見つめてどうかしたの？　さっき注文したばかりだよね？」=“What're you staring holes through the menu for? You just placed an order, no?”
「ああ、いや。メニューの隣にいくつか簡単な作り方が書いてあったんだ」=“Aah, no. It's just that all the dishes have an 'easy to follow' recipe next to them.”
「へえ。見た感じ、けっこうお手軽そうだね」=“Hoh. From the looks of it, they really do seem to be pretty straightforward.”
「ああ。ここに書いてある手順を踏むだけで、こんな料理が作れるんだぜ？　なんかすげーよ」=“Yeah. Even you or me could make this sort of stuff, just by following this stuff, you know? It's kinda amazing.”
「うん、そうだね。[H名]って、料理に興味があるの？」=“Yeah, it is. You cook, [H名]?”
「へへ～ん。こればっかりは内緒だな！」=“Hehehn~, that's a secret!”
「なあ。もし私がこんなの料理作ったら、お前食ってみたいか？」=“Hey. If I made something like this, would you want to eat it?”
「もちろん！　[H名]の料理、楽しみだな～！」=“Of course! Man, I'm looking forward to eating your cooking~!”
「あ、いや。まだ作るって決めたわけじゃねーよ！」=“Ah, no. It's not like I already decided on whether I'll make something or not!”
「もしも作れたら、って話で……別に期待とかすんなよ！」=“It's an 'if', just an 'if'... don't go expecting things, now!”
「う、うん。わかったよ……」=“S-Sure. I got it...”
（とはいっても、つい期待しちゃうな～。[H名]、本当は料理ができるんじゃないのかな？）=(Even if I say that, i just can't help myself from getting hopeful~. Under all that, she can actually cook, can't she?)
「いや、料理なんて全然分かんねーな」=“No, I don't get cooking at all, not one bit.”
「え！？　でも、ずいぶん熱心に眺めてたじゃないか」=“Eh!? But you really were almost staring holes into that menu.”
「いや、これは……ただ気分で眺めてただけだし」=“No, this is... I just felt like it, that's all.”
「そりゃ、ちょっとぐらいは作れたら……なんて考えはしたけどよ」=“I mean, I did think about how... it would have been nice, if I could cook, even a little bit.”
「それってもしかして、俺に料理を作るために……！」=“For my sake...?!”
「おい、勝手な想像してんじゃねえよ。ぶん殴るぞ！」=“Hey, don't go imagining things on your own. I'll fucking kill you!”
「ご、ごめんなさい……」=“I-I'm sorry...”
