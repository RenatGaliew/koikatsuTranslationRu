「あ！　見てみろよ。時間が経って、夜景がちょっと変わってるぜ」=“Ah! Look. It's late enough, that the sky's changing colors.”
「へぇ～、こんな景色も見られるんだね」=“Hoh~, so there's this sort of view out in the world too, huh?”
「この景色に出会えたのも、誰かさんが性欲旺盛なおかげだな」=“It's thanks to a certain someone's pretty big sex drive, that we're getting to see this view, too.”
「ふふ、[H名]も負けてなかったと思うよ」=“Fufu, I don't think you lost out to me though, [H名].”
「うっせーよ！　余計なこと言ってないで、早く帰るぞっ」=“Shaddup! Don't say pointless stuff, let's go home already--”
