「ふぅ、今日もいっぱい遊んだね。すっかり足が棒になっちゃったよ」=“Fuu, we sure had a ton of fun today too. My legs feel like lead.”
「[H名]は疲れてない？」=“What about you, [H名], you tired?”
「ん……大丈夫、平気よ……」=“Nn... it's fine, I'm alright...”
「はは、眠たそうな声で言われても説得力ないよ。俺の肩か膝を貸そうか？」=“Haha, that's not convincing at all, not when you say it with such a sleepy voice. Wanna borrow my shoulder or lap?”
「いらないわよ」=“No need.”
「遠慮しなくていいのに」=“You really don't need to hold back with me, you know?”
「遊び疲れて寝るなんて、そんな子どもみたいなこと私はしないってば」=“I'm not such a little kid as to sleep after playing around all day, dummy.”
「ああ、子どもっぽいから恥ずかしがってたんだ」=“Aah, you were embarrassed because it seems childish, huh?”
「うっ……ち、違うわよ」=“Uu--... y-you've got it wrong.”
「別に俺は気にしないよ。それにここは遊園地なんだから、童心に返って子どもっぽいことしちゃってもいいんじゃない？」=“I don't really mind, you know? Not to mention, we're at the amusement park. What's the harm in returning back to being a kid for a little bit?”
「…………変な理屈考えるのが上手いんだから」=“...You're really good at coming up with weird reasonings.”
「それじゃあ……ちょっと肩、貸して」=“Well then... lemme borrow your shoulder for a bit.”
「はい、どうぞ」=“Here you go.”
「ん、ありがと」=“Nn, thanks.”
「着く前にはちゃんと起こすから、気にせず寝ていいからね」=“I'll wake you up before we have to get off, so feel free to take a nap, okay?”
「うん……」=“Okay...”
「ふ～ん、ふふふ～ん、ふ～ん、ふ～ん♪」=“Fuhn~, fufufuhn~, fuhn~, fuhn~♪”
「待って、その鼻歌はなに？」=“Wait, what's with that hum?”
「子守唄。よく眠れるようにと思って」=“A lullaby. Thought it'd help you sleep.”
「突っ込みどころが多すぎるでしょ……」=“I don't even know where to start with you...”
「えっ、そう？」=“Eh--, what?”
「よく分からないチョイスもそうだし、彼女に子守唄を歌うってどうなのよ」=“Going with such an obscure lullaby is one thing, and I don't even know what to say about a guy humming a lullaby for his girlfriend.”
「今の[H名]は童心に返ってるから、いいかなと」=“Well, since you're back to being a little kid for a bit, I thought it was fine.”
「はぁ、それは余計なお世話。私は……あんたが肩を貸してくれただけで充分なの」=“Haa, that's really not needed. I'm... happy enough just borrowing your shoulder.”
「だから、しばらくこのままでいさせて」=“So, lemme stay like this for a little bit.”
「そっか。うん、分かったよ」=“I see. Okay, got it.”
