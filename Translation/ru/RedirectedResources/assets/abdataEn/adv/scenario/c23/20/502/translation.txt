「あれ？　ずいぶん早いね。まだ待ち合わせ時間前だよ？」=“Huh? You're pretty early. There was still some time on the clock, you know?”
「ワタシだって本気を出せばこんなものですぞ！」=“I can do things properly when I want to too, you know!”
「どのくらい待ってたの？」=“How long did you wait for me?”
「一時間ぐらいですかな。暇つぶしの道具には事欠きませんから」=“An hour, I guess? Not like I lack things to kill time with.”
「それは早すぎだと思うけど……ま、まあ、とりあえず行こうか」=“I really do think an hour is a bit too early but... w-well, let's just go.”
