「恋人が憧れるシチュエーションかぁ。ワタシならゲームしてる時が良いかなぁ」=“A lovey-dovey situation, huh? Something you could do while playing a game would be nice.”
「そうだなぁ……それなら」=“Playing a game, huh... in that case.”
「一緒にゲームしてる彼氏の肩に彼女がいつの間にか寄りかかるっていうのは？」=“How about this. You're playing a multiplayer game with your boyfriend, and before you realize it, you end up resting your head on his shoulder.”
「それ、いいかも！　早速やってみませう」=“That might be nice! Let's try it right now.”
「……う、うん、悪くない。というか、とても良いなぁ。なんか安心する」=“...Y-Yeah, it's not bad. Heck, it's really nice. It kinda makes me feel safe.”
「寄りかかられる方も、頼られてる気がして良いかもしれないね」=“As the one being leaned on, the feeling of being depended upon is nice too.”
