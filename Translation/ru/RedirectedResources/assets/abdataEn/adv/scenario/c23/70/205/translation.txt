「観覧車に乗るのって子供の頃以来なんだなぁ」=“I think the last time I rode a ferris wheel was when I was a kid~”
「昔は絶叫系が苦手だったから、よくお世話になったものです」=“I really wasn't good with screamer rides as a kid so, it often came in handy for my parents.”
「俺は苦手なものはなかったけど、それでも観覧車は特別視していたな」=“There weren't any rides that I couldn't handle, but the ferris wheel was always a special ride for me too.”
「ワタシもだよ。アニメの影響が強くてね」=“Me too. Since I watched a lot of anime back then too.”
「あー、確かにアニメやドラマだと特別扱いされるよね」=“Aah, yeah, they do kinda get special treatment in anime or dramas and such, don't they?”
「やはりラブコメの鉄板というイメージが根強いですな」=“Can't have a romantic comedy without a ferris wheel scene in it, for sure.”
「古今東西、テンプレ、王道と言ってもいい」=“You could almost call it the standard of standards, surpassing borders or ages, a truly universal ride.”
「結構ネタ的には古そうだけどね」=“Though it does feel a bit old school, material wise, doesn't it?”
「使い古されてなお愛されるのだから、それだけの魅力があるということですぞ」=“The fact that it gets used so much is just proof that it's loved that much by everyone.”
「それにデートで観覧車に乗ったとなれば……」=“Not to mention, if you get on a ferris wheel together, on a date...”
「……頂上でのキスをするのがお約束？」=“...You gotta kiss at the top?”
「ですな……」=“Yeah...”
「じゃあ、俺たちもしようか？」=“Wanna do it ourselves then?”
「ほ、本気かいっ？」=“Y-You serious?”
「本気だけど、嫌だった？」=“I am but, if you don't want to...”
「い、嫌だとは言ってない！」=“I-I didn't say that!”
「わ、ワタシだって……女の子、憧れは、あります故、うん」=“I-I'm a... girl too, with girly, dreams, yeah.”
「それなら決まりだね」=“That's settled then.”
………………=.........
「……わぁ、綺麗」=“...Wah, it's so pretty.”
「夜の観覧車が人気な理由、よく分かるね」=“You can really tell just why it's so popular with everyone, can't you?”
「えぇ……こんな素敵な景色、虜になるに決まってるよ……」=“Yes... such a lovely sight, who could resist it...”
「だね。さて、もうすぐ約束の頂上だけど」=“Yeah. Now then, we're almost at the top.”
「わ、わざわざ言わなくても分かってるから……」=“Y-You don't need to go out of your way to say it, I already know...”
「それじゃあ……」=“Well then...”
「んんっ……んぅ……ん……」=“Nn--... nn... nnn...”
「ん……」=“Nn...”
「……いつもと変わらないキスのはずなのに、特別な感じがするなぁ」=“...Even though it's the same kiss as always, it feels special this time~”
「だね……」=“Yeah...”
「なんだかんだで、子供の頃見ていたアニメのシーンで憧れていたのかも」=“Maybe deep down, I've always dreamed about this sort of thing, ever since I saw it in an anime as a kid.”
「なるほど……うん、きっとそうだ！」=“I see... yeah, I'm sure that's it!”
「わ、びっくりした……随分食いつくね」=“Wah, that surprised me... you said that with real gusto.”
「言われてしっくりきたからね」=“Yeah, since it just clicked for me, after you said that.”
「というと？」=“What did?”
「憧れや夢が叶った感じ……それってきっと、すごく特別な瞬間だと思うんだ」=“The moment a deep desire or a dream comes true... it becomes a really special moment, I think.”
「……そしてその瞬間は、すごく特別な思い出になるんだと思う」=“...And that moment, becomes a real special memory.”
「あぁ……確かに。今日のことは一生忘れないと思う」=“Aah... for sure. I don't think I'll ever forget about today.”
「ワタシも。……観覧車に乗ってよかったと心の底から思うよ」=“Me neither. ...I really do feel glad, from the bottom of my heart, that we got on the ferris wheel today.”
「素敵な思い出をありがとうなんだなぁ」=“Thank you for the wonderful memories~”
