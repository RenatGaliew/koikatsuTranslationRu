「本当に楽しかったね。名残惜しいけど、そろそろ帰ろうか」=“That really was fun, wasn't it? It's sad but, let's head home.”
「うむ……そうじゃのう」=“Umu... we ought to.”
「遊園地にいると、魔法にかけられたみたいな気分になるんじゃな」=“The park has a magic of sorts to it, doesn't it? The moment you step in, it gets cast on you.”
「そうだね。今日のことを思い出すだけで楽しい気分がよみがえるから、きっと当分この魔法は解けないな」=“Yeah. Just thinking about the fun we had today lifts my mood up, so I'm sure this magic will last quite a while.”
「魔法が解けそうになったら、その前にふたりでまたここに来るのじゃ」=“If it seems as though it is going to melt away, we must come back here right away to renew it.”
「あぁ……そうだね」=“Yeah... we must.”
