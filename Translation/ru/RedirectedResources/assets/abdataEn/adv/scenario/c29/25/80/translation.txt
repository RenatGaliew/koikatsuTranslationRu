「和食と洋食、どちら派ですか？」=“Between western food and Japanese food, which do you prefer?”
「んー、どっちも好きかな。注文するときはわりと直感で選んでるよ。そっちは？」=“Nn, I like both. I go with whatever my gut tells me to go for, when I order. You?”
「私も両方好きですけれど……どちらかと言えば和食ですね。食べていると落ち着きます」=“I like both cuisines as well but... if I had to pick, I'd pick Japanese food. Eating it makes me calm down.”
「そっか。今日も蕎麦を頼んでるもんね」=“I see. You did go with Soba today, didn't you?”
