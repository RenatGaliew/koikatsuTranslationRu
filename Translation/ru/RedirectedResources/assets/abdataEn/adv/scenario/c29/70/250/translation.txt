「はぁ……さようなら遊園地……」=“Haa... goodbye, amusement park...”
「随分と名残惜しそうな顔をしていますね」=“That's quite the reluctant expression you've got there.”
「もうちょっとだけ遊んでたかったなって思うと、ついね」=“I just wish we could have stayed and had fun for a bit longer, that's all.”
「名残惜しさと言うより、未練の方でしたか」=“More of an attachment, than reluctance, is it?”
