「んー、公園は植物が多くて気持ちいいなー」=“Nn~, there's so much vegetation around here, it feels great, doesn't it?~”
「はは、[H名]は元気だね～」=“Haha, you sure are pretty lively today, [H名]~”
「そういうキミは情けないぞー、いつまで休んでるんだ？」=“And you're being real pathetic, how long are you planning on resting there?”
「俺は、[H名]を見てるだけで十分楽しいからね」=“It's more than enough fun for me to just watch you frolic around.”
「またキミはそんなこと言って……いいから一緒に歩くぞ！」=“Always with that stuff... c'mon, we're walking together!”
「そうだね。それじゃあ、向こうの花が咲いてる方に行ってみない？」=“Guess we should. Well then, how about heading over to that spot, with all those flowers?”
「よし、じゃあ、あそこまで競争だー！」=“Alright, we're racing till there then!”
「あっ、[H名]、待って！」=“Ah--, [H名], wait!”
「綺麗な花が咲いてるなぁ。お、植えてる花のパネルとかもあるんだ」=“Man, there's so many beautiful flowers. Oh, there's even a panel with info on each of the flowers.”
「そうだ、クイズをしよ！　ええっと……この花の名前わかる？」=“Right, how about a quiz? Erhm... know the name of this flower?”
「ん？　それはツツジだろー」=“Hm? That's an Azalea, no?”
「おお！　すごい、合ってる」=“Ooh! Amazing, you got it right.”
「それなら、逆にキミに問題だぞ。この花の名前はわかるかー？」=“In that case, I'll ask you one myself. Know the name of this one?”
「あー……全然わかんないや。コスモスとか？」=“Ah... Nope, not at all. A cosmos or something?”
「違うぞ。これはナズナだな。コスモスはキクの仲間で、もっと花が大きいんだ」=“Nope. This is a Shepherd's Purse. Cosmoses are part of the daisy family so, the flowers are much bigger than this.”
（[H名]って、植物に詳しいんだ。少し自慢そうにしてるのも、かわいいな）=(She knows quite a bit about this stuff. The way she proudly showing off her knowledge, it's so cute)
「そうだ、[H名]、クイズを出すね！　この花の名前わかる？」=“Right, [H名], here's a quiz for you! Know the name of this flower?”
「うーん……わかんないなー」=“Mmm... nope, not at all.”
「でも、花はすごくきれいだなー。匂いもいいし、キミももっと近くで見てみるといいぞー」=“But, the flower itself is really pretty. It smells really nice too, come here and take a closer look at it.”
「本当だ、なんだか甘い匂いがする」=“You're right, it smells kinda sweet.”
「パネルを見るより、実際に近づいて嗅いだりした方が花についてよくわかるのかもね」=“Rather than reading the panel, getting up close like this, and actually smelling the flowers, would probably tell us more about them.”
「そうだなー。あたしもキミの匂いを嗅ぐと色んなことがわかるぞ」=“You're not wrong. Everytime I smell you, I learn all sorts of things about you too.”
「はは、それはすごいね……」=“Haha, that's amazing in its own right...”
