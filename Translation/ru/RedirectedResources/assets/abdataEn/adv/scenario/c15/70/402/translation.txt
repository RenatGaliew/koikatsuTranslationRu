(う～ん、この喫茶店の制服って、落ち着いた感じでかわいいなぁ……)=(Mmm, the staff uniforms in this cafe, are so subdued, so adorable...)
（きっと[H名]にも……）=(I bet [H名] would look real good in one of those...)
「……なーなー。キミ、さっきからどこ見てるんだー？」=“...Hey. Where've you been looking this whole time?”
「そんなにあの店員の子がいいなら、あたしじゃなくてあの子とデートすればいいだろー」=“If that waitress is so cute that you can't help but stare, then just date her instead of me.”
「えっ？　いや、違う違う！　誤解だってば！」=“Eh--? No, that's not it! You're misunderstanding it!”
「俺はただ、ここの喫茶店の制服を見てただけだよ」=“I was just admiring the uniform, that's all.”
「……制服？」=“...The uniform?”
「うん、[H名]が着たらきっと似合うだろうな、と思って」=“Yeah, was just thinking that it'd look real good on you, and stuff.”
「そんなこと言っても、騙されないぞ」=“You can't fool me with a flimsy excuse like that, you know?”
「本当だって！　それに、俺が他の子に見惚れるわけないし」=“It's the truth! Not to mention, I could never get charmed by another girl.”
「この喫茶店に……というより、[H名]よりかわいい子なんて、どこにもいないんだから」=“You're the cutest girl in this entire coff... no, you're the cutest, period. There's no girl out there cuter than you.”
「……そこまで大げさに言われると、ますます怪しいぞー」=“...It just sounds more fishy the more you exaggerate it, you know.”
「いやいや、俺にとっては大げさじゃなくて、本当のことだよ」=“No way, it's not an exaggeration at all, it's the truth.”
「そ、そんなこと……本当に、本気で言ってるのかー？」=“Y-You can't... are you being serious, actually serious?”
「……だったら、もっとあたしのことだけ見ててほしいぞ」=“...In that case, I'd love it if you looked more at me, only at me.”
「キミが他の子を見てると、不安になるだろー」=“You know I'm gonna get nervous, if you start staring at other girls.”
「ごめん、最初から店員の制服を見てるって言っておけばよかったね」=“Sorry, I should have mentioned from the start that I was only looking at her uniform.”
「あ、あたしこそ……勘違いで怒って、悪かったぞ」=“M-Me too... I misunderstood and got mad at you, it was my bad.”
「……よし、これで一件落着だね」=“...Alright, let's leave it at that.”
「じゃあ気を取り直して、あの制服を借りられるか聞きに行こうか！」=“Well then, putting all that aside, let's go ask if we could borrow one of those uniforms!”
「あはは、それは無理だと思うけどなー」=“Ahaha, I don't think that's gonna work.”
