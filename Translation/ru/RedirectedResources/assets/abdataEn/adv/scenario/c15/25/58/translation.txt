「へへー、今日になるの、ずっと待ってたんだぞ」=“Hehe, I was waiting for today to come for the longest time.”
「俺もだよ。じゃあ、行こうか」=“Me too. Well then, let's go.”
「こうやって、芝生の上に座るのっていいよね」=“Sitting on the grass like this is really nice, isn't it?”
「そうだな。でも……ふたりで寝転がった方がさらにいいと思うぞ、うりゃっ！」=“It is. But... I think it'd feel even nicer if we lied down together, uuryaah--!”
「うわっ！？」=“Uwah--!?”
「へへー、どうだ？　あたしと芝生に挟まれて気持ちいいだろ？」=“Hehe, how is it? Feels good to be sandwich between me and the grass like this, no?”
