「なーなー、勉強ってホントに役に立つのかー？」=“Hey, is studying really gonna be helpful to us in the future?”
「きっと、みんな同じこと考えてるよね。でも、勉強は大事だよ」=“I'm sure everyone's got the same question on their minds. However, studying really is important.”
「遊びの時間も大事だぞー？　コーイン、アレのごとく？　って言うしなー」=“Playtime's important too, you know? I mean, they do say, all work and no play makes... uh, well, you get the rest.”
（やっぱり勉強って大事だよな。うん）=(Yep, can't skip your studies, kids.)
