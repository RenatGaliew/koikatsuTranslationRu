「わぁ、綺麗だなー……」=“Wah, it's sure beautiful...”
「観覧車からの景色みたいなものは、他のアトラクションじゃなかなか見れないよね=Other attractions really don't offer the same sort of view you can get from a ferris wheel, do they?
「だなー。あたし、観覧車は何回か乗ったことあるけど、夜の観覧車は初めてだぞ」=“Yeah. I've ridden on ferris wheels a whole lot of times but, it's my first time looking at the night sky from one.”
「昼は見晴らしが良くて気持ちいい感じだけど、夜もそれとはまた違っていいなー」=“The view during the day feels great and is good in its own way but, the night view's pretty darn nice too.”
「夜景もたしかにいいけど、俺にとっては[H名]と一緒にいる方が重要かな」=“The view's certainly great but, to me, having you here next to me is way more valuable.”
「ん？　あたしがどうかしたかー？」=“Nn? Why, is there something special about it?”
「綺麗な夜景より、俺にとっては[H名]と初めて観覧車に乗ったことが大事だからね」=“To me, this experience of being on the ferris wheel with you, for the first time, is something I treasure way more than the pretty view.”
「……照れくさい事を、平気で言うなー、まったく」=“...You always say those sorts of things, with the straightest of faces too, jeez.”
「近くに座ってるせいか、余計に恥ずかしいぞ」=“I don't know if it's because we're sitting as close as we are but, it's really way too embarrassing.”
「二人きりだし、そんなに恥ずかしがらなくても」=“It's just the two of us here, you don't need to be so embarrassing.”
「二人きりだから恥ずかしい、っていうのもあるけどなー」=“It's embarrassing because it's just the two of us here, rather.”
「なんだかんだ、遊園地でも人に囲まれてたし。今日、純粋に二人きりになったのはここが初めてかもなー」=“We were surrounded by people the whole time in the park, for one reason or another. This might be the first time in the entire day, that we've gotten to be alone like this.”
「たしかに、そうかもね」=“For sure, you're not wrong.”
「こうして夜空の中にいると、観覧車というより俺達二人だけの世界に来たみたいだ」=“Hanging in the middle of the night sky like this, it feels less like we're on a ferris wheel, and more like we've entered a world of our own.”
「ずいぶんロマンチックなことを言うんだな、キミは」=“You sure come up with some romantic things.”
「変だったかな？」=“Was it weird?”
「ううん、いいと思うぞ。あたしも、なんだかそんな気分だなー」=“No, it was nice. I'm in that sort of mood too, right now.”
「二人だけの世界、かー。ここが、本当にそうなら……」=“A world of our own, huh. If this place, truly was such a thing...”
「そうなら？」=“If it was?”
「ん……いや、なんでもないぞー。ただ、少し想像してただけだ」=“Nn... no, it's nothing. I was just imagining something.”
「そっか。俺は[H名]と二人きりの世界なら、こうしたいかな」=“I see. For me, if this was a world of our own, with just the two of us, this is what I'd love to do.”
「えっ、ちょっ――」=“Eh--, hey--...”
「んんっ……」=“Nnn--...”
「ん……」=“Nnn...”
「っ……き、キミはすぐそういうことするんだからなー」=“--...Y-You always spring that sort of thing out of nowhere.”
「嫌だった？」=“Didn't like it?”
「それは……」=“That's...”
「……嫌、ではないけどなー」=“...No, I wouldn't say I didn't like it.”
「それなら、もう一回いいかな？」=“In that case, mind if I go in for another one?”
「……もう、わざわざ言わなくてもわかるだろー？」=“...Jeez, you don't need me to say it out loud for you, do you?”
「いや、[H名]の口から直接聞きたいんだ。どうかな？」=“No, I want to hear it directly from your mouth, [H名]. How about it?”
「もう……うん、あたしも、もっとキミとキスしたいぞ」=“Jeez... Yeah, I want to kiss you more too, lots more.”
「ありがとう！　……好きだよ、[H名]」=“Thanks! ...I love you, [H名].”
「ん……んんっ……」=“Nn... nnn--...”
「……ふぅ。ん……そ、その目はなんだ？」=“...Fuu. Nn... W-What's with those eyes?”
「降りるまで、ずっとキスしてたいなと思って」=“I was just thinking, that I wanna keep kissing you, until we get to the bottom.”
「も、もうっ……キミは本当に仕方ないなー」=“J-Jeez--... there really is no helping you.”
