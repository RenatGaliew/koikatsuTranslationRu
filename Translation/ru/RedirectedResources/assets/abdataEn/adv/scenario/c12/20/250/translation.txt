「あぁ、さらば遊園地……また会おう……」=“Aah, goodbye, amusement park... let us meet again...”
「おいおい、感傷に浸り過ぎだろ……そんなに楽しかったのか？　遊園地」=“Oi oi, aren't you overdoing it a bit... did you enjoy it that much?”
「もちろん、普通に遊ぶだけで楽しいのに、[H名]と一緒だったんだよ。もう楽園はここにありって感じだったね」=“Of course, it's fun enough by itself, but you were with me too. It was basically paradise on earth.”
「そこまでは大袈裟過ぎるけど、あたしも楽しかったよ、おまえと一緒に遊園地で遊べてさ」=“I'm not gonna exaggerate that much, but I had fun too. I had fun being here with you.”
「また来ようね。二人で一緒に」=“Let's come again, okay? Together.”
