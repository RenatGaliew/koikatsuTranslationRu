「ぁっはは……本当にその……カラオケでシちゃったな……」=“Ahhahah... we really... did it at a karaoke box, huh...”
「うん、次に来た時、絶対思い出すよね。むしろカラオケってそういう場所になるかも……」=“Yeah, definitely gonna remember this next time, won't we? Maybe Karaoke might end up becoming a place to just have sex for us...”
「それは流石にまずい！　いつか絶対見つかるからな？　今日はたまたま運が良かっただけなんだからな？」=“Miss me with that! We're definitely gonna get caught one of these days, you know? We just got lucky today, okay?”
「うーん、でも見つかる気配もなかったし。するにはいい場所だと思うんだけどなぁ」=“Nnnn, I don't really think anyone even remotely noticed. I think it's a pretty good place to shack up, honestly~”
「何でそんなに気に入ってるんだよ……確かに防音とかは効いてるから、声を抑えなくていいのはありがたいけど……」=“Why're you so into it... I mean, the rooms are soundproofed, so it's nice that we don't have to hold in our moans but...”
「でしょ？　だからまたいつかしようね？　カラオケエッチ」=“Right? So let's do it again someday, okay? Karaoke sex~”
