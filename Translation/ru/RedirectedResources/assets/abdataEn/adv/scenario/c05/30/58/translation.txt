「今日の儀式、楽しみだね……えへへ」=“I'm really excited, about today's ritual... ehehe.”
「そうだね……それじゃ、行こうか」=“Right... let's go then.”
「そう……こうやって手を繋いで……空に掲げるの」=“That's it... hold my hand like this... and look at the sky.”
（いつやっても手を繋いでるだけにしか見えないけど……嬉しそうだし、いいよな）=(No matter how many times we do it, doesn't seem to be anything except normal hand holding to me... well, she seems happy, so it's fine)
