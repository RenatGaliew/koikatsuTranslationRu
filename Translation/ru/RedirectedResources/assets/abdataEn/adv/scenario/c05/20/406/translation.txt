「あ、もうこんな時間か。だいぶ話しこんじゃったね」=“Ah, it's already this late, huh? We really got into our chat, didn't we?”
「あなたの話が面白いから、時間を忘れてたよ」=“Chatting with you is always really fun so, I forgot the time too.”
「はは、そう言ってくれて嬉しいよ」=“Haha, makes me happy to hear you say that.”
「また一緒に来て、のんびり過ごそうか」=“Let's come here again to chill out, shall we?”
「うんっ。今度は“かれら”の話、もっと色々教えてあげるね」=“Yeah--. I'll tell you lots more about "them" next time, okay?”
