「はい、あ～ん……どう？　おいしい？」=“Here, open wide~... how is it? Is it tasty?”
「うん、おいしい」=“Yeah, really tasty.”
「これは、早起きして作ったの。そう言ってくれて嬉しい……」=“I got up early, to make this. So hearing you say that makes me really happy...”
「本当においしいよ。[H]に食べさせてもらってるからかな？」=“It really is delicious. Wonder if it's because you're feeding it to me?”
「えへへ、あなたとこうしてると……この星にいても幸せになれそうって思っちゃう」=“Ehehe, when we spend time like this... being stuck on this planet doesn't feel as awful anymore.”
