「ごめん。これ以上は……」=“Sorry. I really can't take this...”
「だって……まだ、しなきゃいけないこともいっぱいあるのに」=“I mean... there's so much stuff, we haven't done yet.”
「本当にごめん……」=“I really am sorry.”
「[P]くんのことも助けたかった。……悲しいけど、ひとりで待つしかないの……？」=“I wanted to save you too, [P]-kun. ...Do I really have no option, other than to wait for them by myself...?”
