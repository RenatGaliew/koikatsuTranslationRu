「ふと思ったんだけどさ……さっきのエッチ、“かれら”に見られていたりしないの？」=“I just realized this but... could "they" see us, having sex there?”
「……“かれら”はいつも、私を見守ってる……だから、ここだと、よく見えたかも……」=“..."They" are always watching over me... so, I think they probably did see us, very clearly...”
「そ、そっか。俺たちの仲を報告するいい機会になった……のかな？」=“I-I see. Do you think that it was, uh... a good way to report our relationship to them?”
「うん……きっと、銀河一素敵な２人だって、祝福してくれてる」=“Yeah... I'm sure that they're cheering us on, as the most lovely couple in the entire milky way.”
「銀河一か……スケールがでかいなぁ」=“The entire milky way, huh... that sure is some scale.”
