「そういえばさ、どこか寄り道したい所とかないかな？」=“That reminds me, do you really not have a place you wanna stop by on the way?”
「え～めんどくさ～い」=“Eh~, that's a pain~”
「そ、そうか……寄り道しない方なんだね」=“I-I see... Not the type to stop by at places, are you?”
「んん～……そうかもね～。誰かと一緒に帰ったりもあんまりしないよ～」=“Nnn~... might be~. I don't walk home along with someone else all that often either, you know?~”
