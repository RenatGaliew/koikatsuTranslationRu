「えぇ～面倒だからいいよ～……って言われたらどうするっすか？」=“Eeh~, it's a pain so I'm good~... if I said that, what would ya do?”
「ええっ！？　……もっと仲良くなってやる……とか？」=“Eeh--!? ... Like, I guess I'd try to get even closer to you first... and stuff?”
「前向き過ぎて怖いっす。……しょーがないから付き合ってあげよっか～」=“You're such a glass-half-full guy it's almost scary. ...It can't be helped, I'll go along with you~”
