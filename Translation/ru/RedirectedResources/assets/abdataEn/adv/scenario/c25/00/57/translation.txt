「デート、デート……、初めてっすよこんなこと……」=“A date, a date... it's my first time, you know, doing something like this...”
「俺だって緊張してるよ。今日は一緒に楽しもう」=“I'm nervous myself too, you know. Let's have a blast together today.”
「インドア派なんで～、行先とか全部お任せなんだけど～」=“I'm the indoorsy sort so~, I'mma leave all of the details to you~”
「はは、大丈夫だよ、任せて」=“Haha, it's alright, I'll take care of it.”
「ふ～ん、ま、まあたまには悪くないかな～」=“Mmm, w-well, this sort of thing isn't all that bad either, every so often~”
「楽しんでもらえてなにより」=“I'm glad you had fun.”
「でも、人目を感じるだけでドッと疲れるね～」=“But, just feeling others' eyes on me really tires me out~”
「ああ、俺も人混みは苦手だな」=“Yeah, I'm bad with crowds myself too.”
「ま～疲れたけど良かったよ。ありがと～、またね～」=“Well~, it was tiring but, I had fun. Thanks~, see ya~”
