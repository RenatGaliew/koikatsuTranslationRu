「ねぇ、今いいかな？」=“Hey, is it a good time right now?”
「ん～？　私に何か～？」=“Nn~? Need something from me~?”
「暇そうにしてるなって思って。俺は[P名前]って言うんだ」=“You just seemed like you were free. I go by [P名前].”
「そっか～って知ってるけどね。ひとりだけの男子、目立ってるもんね～」=“I see~, already knew that though. You're the only boy here, you stand out a fair bit~”
「そ、そうかな……それで何か話でもしたいなって」=“T-That so?... Anyways, I was just thinking that maybe it'd be nice to have a chat about, well, something.”
「何かって言われても困るんですけど～、簡単な質問ぐらいなら答えるよ～」=“I can't exactly come up with 'something' on the spot like that~, but I guess I can answer any questions you might have~”
