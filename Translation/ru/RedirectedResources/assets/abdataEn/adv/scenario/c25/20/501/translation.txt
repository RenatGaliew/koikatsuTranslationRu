「はぁ、はぁ、はぁ……どうにか、間に合った……ふぅ」=“Haa, haa, haa... I made it, somehow... fuu.”
「キミ……顔が汗だくだよ～？　体調でも悪いの～？」=“Your face... it's dripping with sweat, you know? Don't feel to good today~?”
「いや、遅刻しそうだったから猛ダッシュで来たんだ」=“No, I felt like I wasn't gonna make it in time, so I ran all the way here.”
「まあ、私もすぐ来てまたすぐ動くの面倒くさいし～、別に少しぐらいなら遅刻しても平気だよ～」=“Well, I only just got here too, and moving again right away's a pain~, I wouldn't have minded all that much if you were a bit late, you know~”
「俺を気遣ってくれたんだね。ありがとう」=“You were worried about me, weren't you? Thank you.”
（さて、今日はどこに行こうかな）=(Now then, where shall we go today?)
