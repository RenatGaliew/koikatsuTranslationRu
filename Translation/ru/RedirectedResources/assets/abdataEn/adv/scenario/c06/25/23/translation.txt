「実は……その、家庭科の授業でくれえぷをこしらえたのですが、是非、貴方に召し上がっていただきたくて……」=“The truth is... uhm, I made these "crepes" during our home economics class just then, and I wanted nothing more than to see you trying them...”
「お世辞にも見てくれが良いとは言えないのですが、貴方への気持ちはしっかりと込めたつもりです」=“One could not call them "good" as they look, even as flattery, however I have packed them full of my feelings for you.”
