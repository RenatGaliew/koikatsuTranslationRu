「うぅ……自分が情けない……」=“Uuu... I'm so pathetic...”
「なんで？　もしかして嫌やったん？　私は嬉しかったんやけど……」=“Why? Did you actually hate it? I was really happy though...”
「ううん、俺も嬉しかったけど……何て言うか……[H名]の前で恥ずかしいところを見せてしまったというか……」=“No, that's not it, it made me really happy too but... How do I say this... I feel like I showed a really pathetic side of me to you today...”
「あはは、そげんこと気にせんとよ。気持ち良くなれたっちゃけん、それでいいと。はい、あとは着くまで手を繋ぐん♪」=“Ahaha, don't worry about things like that. As long as it felt good, that's all that matters. Here, all that's left to do is to hold hands till we get to our station♪”
