「今日はその、告白の練習をしたいと思ってるんだ」=“Today, uhm, I was thinking that we could try maybe practicing confessions.”
「えっ……あなた、誰かに告白するの？」=“Eh--... are you going to confess to someone?”
「い、いや、そういうワケじゃないんだけど……その時のためにね」=“N-No, that's not it... but well, it'd be good prep for when the time comes.”
「そ、そう……じゃあ、私も……その時のために、ね？　勘違いしちゃ、だめよ？」=“I-I see... then, I guess I'll join too... just as prep for that time too, okay? Don't misunderstand it, okay?”
「……も、もうだめ……顔が熱いわ……」=“...I-I can't anymore... my face is burning up...”
「ははっ、俺も……で、でもなんか……幸せだよ」=“Haha--, mine too... b-but how do I say this... I feel happy.”
