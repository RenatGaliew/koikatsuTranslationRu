（さて……ちょっと早すぎたかな……待ち合わせの時間までまだ３０分もある……）=(Now then... did I come here a bit too early... there's still 30 minutes till we said we'd meet up...)
………………=.........
「お待たせ。今日は随分と早いわね」=“Sorry for the wait. You're here early today.”
「うん、今日のデートが楽しみでね、大分早く来ちゃったんだ」=“Yeah, I was really looking forward to our date, you see, so I came here quite early.”
「ふふふ……まるで遠足の朝の子供みたいね」=“Fufufu... like a kid on the day of a field trip.”
「まあ、気分的には同じようなもんかな」=“Well, you're right about that.”
「それじゃあ、行こうか」=“Well then, let's go.”
