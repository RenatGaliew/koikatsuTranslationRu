「ああ、帰りの電車は寂しくなっちゃうな……」=“Aah, the train ride back home's going to be so sad...”
「ほら、遠足はもうおしまいよ。子供みたいにふてくされない」=“C'mon, our trip's over for today. Now don't sulk like a kid at the end of a field trip.”
「どうせ子供ですよ」=“We are actually kids though.”
「それに、家に帰るまでが遠足よ？　気を抜いちゃだめ」=“Not to mention, the trip's still on until we get home, you know? No letting your focus slip.”
