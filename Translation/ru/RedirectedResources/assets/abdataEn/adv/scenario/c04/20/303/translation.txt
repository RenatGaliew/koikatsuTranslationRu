「ふぅ……結構歌ったわね。そろそろ時間だけど、どうする？」=“Fuu... we sang quite a lot. Our slot's almost up, what do you want to do?”
CHOICE:『まだ歌い足りないんじゃない？』=You've still not had enough, no?
CHOICE:『帰る仕度をしよっか』=Let's grab our stuff and go.
「[H名]は、まだ歌い足りないんじゃない？」=“You still haven't had enough singing, no?”
「ふふ、バレてた？　実はもう少し歌いたかったの」=“Fufu, is it that obvious? I honestly want to sing a little bit more.”
「じゃあ、延長の電話をするよ」=“Then, I'll put in the call for an extension.”
「今日はもう帰ろうか」=“Let's go home for today.”
「わかったわ。少し歌いすぎたかしら？」=“Got it. Did we go a little bit too hard there?”
「はは、俺はそうかも。じゃあ帰り支度をしようか」=“Haha, I did for sure. Then, let's get our stuff ready.”
「そうだな……あと一曲歌ったら出ようか」=“Let's see... let's go home after singing one last song.”
「最後だし、[H名]が入れていいよ」=“It's the last one anyway, you can take it, [H名].”
「いいの？　……それじゃあ、あの曲を入れるわ」=“You sure? ...Well then, I'll go with that song.”
『何度も何度も何度も何度も迷って つまづいても♪』=『No matter how many, how many, how many, how many times I lose my way♪』
（やっぱり[H名]は上手いなぁ……）=(She really is just so good at it...)
