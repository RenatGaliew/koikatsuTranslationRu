「やった、今日の日替わりは唐揚げだ」=“Yay, today's special is deep fried chicken.”
「えー、唐揚げの日って……女子だと逆に人気がない方なんだけどな」=“Eh~, deep fried chicken... it's actually hard to get excited about that as a girl, honestly.”

「もう、そんな辛そうに我慢しなくても……一つあげよっか？」=“Jeez, you don't need to bear it that badly... want a bite of mine?”
「はぅっ！？　う……ぅ……はぅ……く……ぅ……お……お願いします……」=“Hauu--!? Uu... uu... hauu... kuh... uu... p... please...”
「あ、ははは……すごい葛藤だったね」=“Ah, hahaha... took you a while to beat that inner opposition down.”
