「んーっ、結構頑張ったね！」=“Nn--, we really put our all in that, huh!”
「そうだね。こんなに勉強が捗ったのは久しぶりだよ」=“Yeah. It's been a while since I've gotten so much done in one go.”
「私も！　やっぱり誰かと一緒にすると違うなぁ」=“Me too! It really is different, doing it together with someone.”
「特に相手が男の子だと……頑張らなきゃって気になっちゃう。えへへ」=“Especially when the study partner's a boy... I just feel like I have to do my best, you know? Ehehe~”
「あはは。俺もきみが傍にいると頑張れるかも」=“Ahaha. Having you next to me makes me put out my 100% too.”
「わわっ、私限定だ……も、もう……照れちゃうよぅ……」=“Wawah--, just me... j-jeez... you'll make me blush...”
「あはは、ごめん。でも、本当だよ」=“Ahaha, sorry. But, it's true.”
