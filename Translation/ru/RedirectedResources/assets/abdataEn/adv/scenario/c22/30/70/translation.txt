「今日のところはちょっと難しいかも……頭パンクしちゃいそう」=“This might be some of the hardest homework I've done till now... Feels like my head's gonna rip.”
「うーん……俺も。理解するのに時間かかりそうだよ」=“Mmm... me too. Just understanding it's taking quite a lot of time.”
「えへへ、私だったら時間は平気だよ。ギリギリまで勉強しよ？」=“Ehehe, I'm good on time, personally. Let's study until we can't anymore?”
「いいの？」=“You sure?”
「私が君と勉強したいの！　二人の方が捗るんだもん！」=“I want to study next to you! I get so much more done together with you!”
「あはは、そうだね。それじゃあと少し、頑張ろう」=“Ahaha, right. Well then, let's keep at it.”
「おー！」=“Yeah~!”
