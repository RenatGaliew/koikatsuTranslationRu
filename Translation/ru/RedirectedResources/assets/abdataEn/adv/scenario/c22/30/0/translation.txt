「今、ちょっといいかな？　君と話したいんだけど」=“Hey, do you have a moment? I'd like to chat with you.”
「わわっ、話しかけられちゃった！」=“Wawah--, you're really talking to me!”
「あっ、ごめん！　嫌だった？」=“Ah--, sorry! Would you rather not?”
「ううんううん、違うの！」=“No, no, I want to!”
「男の子が転入してきたって聞いてたから……もし話しかけられたらどうしようって、ずっと緊張してたの。ごめんね」=“It's just that, I'd heard that a boy transferred in... and I got real nervous, didn't know what I'd do if you actually came to talk to me. Sorry~”
「あー、そうだよね。いきなり男が入ってきたら焦るよね」=“Ah, of course. Having a boy transfer into an all-girls school would make just about anybody anxious.”
「うん。でも……お話ししやすそうな人で良かった。私からもお願いしていい？　君のお話聞きたいな」=“Exactly. But... I'm glad, you seem like an easy guy to chat with. Mind if I ask for that from my end too? I'd love to hear what you have to say.”
「もちろん！　よろしくね！」=“Of course! Let's get to know each other!”
