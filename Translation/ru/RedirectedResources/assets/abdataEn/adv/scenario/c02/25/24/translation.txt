「おーっほっほっほ。先程の家庭科の授業で作った、このパウンドケーキ……差し上げますわ！」=“Ohohohoh. I have brought this pound cake, that I just made at home economics... and I shall give it to you!”
「ありがとう」=“Thank you.”
「あなたのために作りましたの。粉一粒残さず、ご賞味くださいませね。では、ごきげんよう」=“I made it for you. Relish it with gusto, without leaving behind a single morsel. Well then, good day.”
