「……んー、約束の時間なのに、来ないな。って、あ……来た来た………………って、随分ゆっくり歩いてる……遅刻してるのに」=“...Nnn, it's already the time we said we'd meet up on, but she's not here. Wait, that's... that's her alright... and she's sure walking real leisurely... even though she's late.”
「ごきげんよう、お待たせてしてしまいまして？」=“Good day to you. Did I make you wait?”
「あ、うん……少しね。けど、随分ゆっくり歩いて来ていたね」=“Ah, yeah... a little bit. But, you were walking pretty darn leisurely there, weren't you?”
「ふふ、男性は待たせて当然ですもの。それに、このわたくしが遅刻ごときで慌ててしまうとお思い？　さ、参りましょう」=“Fufuh, it is only natural for a man to have to wait. Besides, do you think one such as me would concern herself with concepts such as lateness? Now then, let us go.”
「う、うん、エスコートさせてもらうよ」=“O-Okay. I'll escort you.”
