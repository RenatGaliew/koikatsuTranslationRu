「え……どうしたの？」=“Eh... what's the matter?”
「ううん。ただ、愛想を尽かすってこういう感じなんだなって、思ってるだけだから」=“Nothing. I was just thinking that maybe this is what it feels like to fall out of love for someone.”
「えっ？　ちょ、ちょっと待って」=“Eh--? W-Wait, hold on a sec.”
「ごめんね、もう私に構わないで。私から本を読む時間を奪わないで……！」=“Sorry, don't bother yourself with me anymore though. Don't steal away my time from books...!”
