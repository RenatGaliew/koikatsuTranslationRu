「夢の終わり……これから現実に帰るんだね……」=“The dream's over... we're going back to reality, aren't we...”
「うん……夢みたいな時間って、あっという間だ……」=“Yeah... the dreamy time, flew by in no time at all...”
「でも、現実に帰っても[P名]君と一緒なら……。この夢が覚めても平気」=“But, if you're going to be with me, even after we return to reality... then I don't mind waking up.”
