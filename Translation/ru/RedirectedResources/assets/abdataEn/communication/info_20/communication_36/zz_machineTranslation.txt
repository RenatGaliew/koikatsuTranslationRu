「……んっ、フフッ……そうよ……下僕にしてあげる……」=“... Mmm... Yes... I'll make you my servant...”
「はぁ……３秒あげる。いますぐ目を閉じるか、私に潰されるか、選びなさい」=“You have ...3 seconds. You have three seconds to close your eyes right now or I will crush you.”
「ほら、おすわり。私が肌を晒してあげてるのよ？　礼儀をわきまえなさい」=“Here, sit down. I'm exposing my skin to you, okay?　Have some decency.”
「貴方、図書室にお喋りをしに来たの？　随分冒涜的なのね」=“Have you come to the library for a chat?　That's very blasphemous.”
「ふーん、私も舐められたものね。その頭、文字通り叩き直してあげるわ」=“Hmm, I've been licked. I'm literally going to beat your head in.”
「あら、練習の邪魔をしに来たのかしら？」=“Are you here to interrupt my practice?”
「まさか見学希望？　貴方が？　プッ、冗談は顔だけにして」=“You want to watch?　You?　Pfft. Keep your jokes to your face.”
「貴方いつもフラフラしてるわね。間抜け面を晒すのが趣味なの？　暇人」=“You're always wandering around, aren't you? Is it your hobby to look like a fool?　Boredom.”
「何をウロウロしているの？　餌が足りないのかしら？」=“What are you doing wandering around?　Are you running low on food?”
「偉そうと言いたいの？　家畜の分際で、随分生意気な口を利くのね」=“Are you trying to call me bossy?　You can't be so cocky when you're a domestic animal.”
「プッ、褒めてるつもり？　ボロ雑巾のような貴方に言われても嬉しくないわね」=“Pfft. Is that a compliment?　I don't like it when you talk about me like a rag doll.”
「貴方、退屈ね。もう少し楽しませてくれると思ったのだけれど」=“You're boring me. I thought you'd be more entertaining.”
「[H名]さんって、誰にでもそんな感じなの？」=“Are you like that with everyone, [H名]?”
「当たり前でしょ。……何？　もっと雑に扱って欲しいの？」=“Of course not... What?　Do you want me to be less rough with you?”
「ふぅん、それで口説いているつもりだとしたら、男として終わってるわね」=“Hmm. If you think you're hitting on me, you're not a man.”
「それ、本気で聞いてるの？　だとしたら貴方、かなり気持ち悪いわよ」=“Are you seriously asking me that?　You'd be pretty sick if you did.”
「まさか、自分がタイプだと言われるとか期待してる？　貴方は男性ではなくオスでしょ？」=“Are you expecting me to tell you that you're my type?　You're not a man, you're a male.”
「厄介ね、そういう男は自分のルールを押し付けたがるわ。滅ぼすべきよ」=“That's the trouble, those men like to impose their own rules. They should be destroyed.”
「いいんじゃない。自由を奪って、泣かせてやりたくなるわ」=“It's okay. It makes me want to take away their freedom and make them cry.”
「いらない存在ね。私に合わせられない男になんて興味はないわ」=“I don't want him. I'm not interested in a man who can't adjust to me.”
「いいわね。どこまで良い人でいられるのか、試したくなる」=“That's nice. I want to see how good he can be.”
「自信があるのは良い事よ。それをポッキリ折ってあげた時の顔が楽しみ」=“It's good to be confident. I can't wait to see the look on your face when I snap it off.”
「ナルシストはお呼びじゃないわ。気持ち悪くて吐き気がする」=“I don't need a narcissist. It's disgusting and makes me want to vomit.”
「は？　貴方、少し息を止めてなさい。深刻な空気汚染よそれ……」=“What?　You need to hold your breath. That's some serious air pollution...”
「普段は優しくないと言いたいの？　ふぅん、貴方何様？」=“Are you saying you're not usually nice?　Hmm, who are you?”
「下半身でしかモノを考えられないの？　救いようのない下等生物ね」=“Who are you to think only with your lower half?　You're an irredeemable lowlife.”
「はっきりしない男ね。もう答えなくていいわ。どうでもよくなったもの」=“You're so unclear. I don't need to answer anymore. I don't care anymore.”
「そう、私も好きよ。ただ、貴方と違って適度にしかしないけれどね」=“Yes, I like it too. Yes, I like to exercise, although unlike you, I only do it in moderation.”
「フッ、だから肥えるのよ。でもまぁ、無駄な汗をかきたくないという意見には賛成ね」=“That's why you get fat. But I agree with you about not wasting sweat.”
「フッ、そこまで開き直れれば苦労しないのでしょうね。少しだけ見習うわ」=“If you can be so open-minded, you'll have no trouble at all. I'll learn a little from you.”
「目を合わせてこないで、気持ち悪いわ」=“Don't make eye contact with me. It's disgusting.”
「貴方の顔、悪夢に出てきそう。気つけにはいいかもね」=“Your face is like something out of a nightmare. It's a good distraction.”
「結局そこを見るのね、単純過ぎて呆れるわ」=“That's what you look for. You're so naive.”
「バレてないと思ってる？　次は目を抉るわ、一切容赦はしない」=“You think I don't know that?　Next time, I'll gouge out your eyes, and there will be no mercy.”
「はい、残念。面倒だから自分で目を潰しなさい、ほら早くしなさい愚図」=“Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but it's too much trouble. Go ahead and blind yourself, you fool.”
「見ているのに何もわからない。低能過ぎて溜息が出るわ……はぁっ」=“I'm looking at you and I don't know what to do. You're so incompetent, I can't help but sigh... Huh.”
「ふぅん、そんなに手がいらないの？　無いと色々不便よ？」=“Hmm, you don't need your hands that much?　It's so inconvenient without them.”
「言葉が通じないのなら、体に覚えさせるしかないわね」=“If you can't communicate, you'll have to let your body learn.”
「わかった、痛くしてあげる。まさか、犬以下の変態だったなんてね」=“Okay, I'll make it hurt. I can't believe you're less of a pervert than a dog.”
「で？　この後はどうするつもり？　考え無しなら酷い事になるけど？」=“Well?　What are you going to do now?　If you don't think about it, you're in deep shit, aren't you?”
「気の迷い、ではすまないわよ？　それとも、豚は豚箱にという事かしら？」=“You can't just let your mind wander, you know.　Or do you think pigs belong in the pigpen?”
「短い付き合いだったわね。次に会えるのは何年後かしら……フフッ」=“We've only known each other a short time. I wonder how long it will be before I see you again...”
「へぇ、何のつもりかしら？　私の頭を汚して、タダで済むと思っているの？」=“Oh, what do you think you're doing?　You think you can get away with messing with my head for free?”
「やめなさい。汚い手で触らないで、雑菌が移るわ」=“Stop it. Don't touch me with your dirty hands, you'll get germs.”
「はぁっ、言葉が通じる相手だと思った私が馬鹿だった、それだけの事ね」=“Huh, I was a fool to think I could communicate with you, that's all.”
「ねぇ、私も頬を触らせて？　貴方だって、誰もわからなくしてあげるわ」=“Hey, can I touch your cheek too?　I'll make sure no one recognizes you.”
「軽薄ね。考えも行動も、何もかも軽くて薄くて、嫌になるわ」=“You're frivolous. Everything you think, everything you do, is so light and thin, it's disgusting.”
「少しは怖さを教えてあげた方がいいみたいね。はぁ、私って優しいわ」=“Maybe I should teach you to be a little afraid. Oh, I'm so sweet.”
「安心なさい、手が使えなくなっても飼ってあげるわ。私のペットとしてね」=“Don't worry, I'll keep you even after you lose the use of your hands. You'll be my pet.”
「フフッ、貴方、案外見所があるかもしれないわね」=“Pfft, you might be interesting to see.”
「ほら、私は何を望んでる？　無い頭を使って考えなさい。長くは待たないわよ」=“Come on, what do I want?　Use your brain. I won't be waiting long.”
「私が一番嫌いなものを教えてあげましょうか？　退屈よ」=“Shall I tell you what I hate the most?　Boredom.”
「無駄な時間ね……不愉快だわ」=“You're wasting my time... You're making me uncomfortable.”
「さようなら。もう二度と、私の視界に入らない事、わかったわね？」=“Goodbye. I don't want to see you again, do you understand?”
「ふぅん、私ともう話す事はないと？　貴方、何様？」=“Hmm, you don't want to talk to me anymore?　Who the hell are you?”
「は？　何がしたかったの？　馬鹿にしないで」=“What?　What do you want?　Don't be ridiculous.”
「悪くない提案ね。乗ってあげるわ。感謝しなさい」=“That's not a bad offer. I'll take you up on it. You should be grateful.”
「馬鹿につける薬は無いと言うけれど、変態にも無さそうね」=“They say there's no medicine for stupidity, but it seems there's no medicine for perversion either.”
「へぇ、もうこの時点で、何を言っても言い訳よ？　覚悟しなさい」=“Well, at this point, anything you say is an excuse, right?　Prepare yourself.”
「はぁ、本当に低俗ね。そのみっともなく膨らんだもの、潰してあげましょうか？」=“Oh, you are so vulgar. Would you like me to crush that disgusting bulge for you?”
「良かったわね。これで貴方は一生私に逆らえないわ。フフッ」=“Good for you. Now you will never be able to resist me again. Hmm.”
「ほら、感想は？　男の目線というのも興味あるわ。正直に言ってみなさい」=“So, what do you think?　I'm interested in a man's point of view. Tell me honestly.”
「よーく見ておきなさい。貴方が水着を見れる機会なんて、この先ないでしょうから」=“Take a good look. You'll never get to see me in a bathing suit again.”
「少しは本を読みなさい。足りない脳でも、多少はマシになるでしょう」=“Read some books. Even if your brain isn't up to it, it could use some work.”
「ほら、もっと焦りなさい。私の期待に応えるのは、難しいわよ？」=“Come on, be more impatient. It's hard to live up to my expectations, isn't it?”
「ほら、タオルは？　気が利かない豚ね。何の役にも立たないわ」=“Here, where's your towel?　You are a witless pig. It's not going to help you.”
「どれだけ見学しても無駄よ。貴方には才能が無いって、一目でわかるわ」=“It doesn't matter how many times you visit. I can see at once that you have no talent.”
「暇なら早く帰ったら？　家畜小屋の位置も忘れてしまったの？」=“If you're not busy, why don't you go home?　Have you forgotten where the shed is?”
「あら、いつからいたの？　貴方って影が薄いのね」=“Oh, how long have you been here?　You're so shady.”
「色々あるわよ。例えば、豚を苛めて遊んだりとかね。フフフッ」=“There are many ways to be. There are many things you can do, like tormenting pigs for fun. Huh.”
「特にないわね。あったとしても、貴方ごときでは理解できないものよ」=“Not really. Even if there were, you wouldn't understand it.”
「えぇ、無駄な馴れ合いは嫌いよ。騒がしいだけで、何も産み出さないもの」=“Yes, I don't like useless socializing. I don't like useless congeniality. It makes too much noise and produces nothing.”
「えぇ、それはもう厳しくね。優しくするだけが愛じゃないのよ？」=“Yes, I'm very strict about it. Being nice isn't the only way to love.”
「は？　尽くす？　私が？　月並みだけど、寝言は寝て言えというやつね」=“What?　Devoted?　Me?　That's a bit of a cliché, but you know what they say about sleeping in.”
「無いわ。というより不可能ね。この私に釣り合う相手なんていないもの」=“No, it doesn't. It's more like impossible. There is no one who can match me.”
「フフッ、やってみなさい。一生後悔する事になるわよ？」=“Go ahead, try it. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.”
「あるわよ。躾けて欲しいとお願いされたら、断るのも可哀相でしょ？」=“Yes, I have. I have. If someone asks you to discipline them, how can you say no?”
「女の子の匂いってエッチだよね？」=“A girl's scent is very erotic, isn't it?”
「そうね、貴方のドブのような匂いとは大違い。芳香剤でも飲んだら？」=“Yeah, it's a lot different than your dank smell. Why don't you take an air freshener?”
「それは貴方が男だからよ。浅はかで、肉欲丸出しな発言ね」=“That's because you're a man. That's a very shallow and carnal thing to say.”
「あるわ。気に入った相手の、全てを支配したいと思うのは当然でしょ？」=“Yes. Isn't it natural to want to control everything about someone you like?”
「貴方はどうなの？　いえ、やっぱりいいわ。聞くまでもないもの」=“What about you?　No, I don't want to. I don't have to ask.”
「あら、意外ね。貴方もなんでも辛くすれば美味しいと言う単純思考かと思っていたわ」=“I'm surprised. I thought you were a simpleton who thought everything tasted better when it was spicy.”
「私が少し揺らすだけで、気持ち悪い顔で見ているものね。ほら、今も」=“You look at me funny when I shake them a little. Like now.”
「幼女趣味の犯罪者予備軍を発見。速やかに通報した方が良さそうね。フフッ」=“We have a juvenile predator on the loose. I'd better report him immediately. Huh.”
「ふぅん、意外ね。男って皆、余計な肉は嫌がるのかと思っていたわ」=“Hmm, that's surprising. I thought all men didn't like extra flesh.”
「普通……簡単に言ってくれるわね。女の努力も知らずに」=“I thought all men hated extra flesh... You make it sound so easy. You don't even know how hard a woman works.”
「私と目を合わせる時は、跪いて見上げなさい。それが作法よ」=“When you make eye contact with me, kneel down and look up. That's how it's done.”
「目で何か訴えているつもり？　理解する気もないから、口を使いなさい」=“Are you trying to tell me something with your eyes?　I don't want to understand you, so use your mouth.”
「右目と左目、どっちがいいかしら？　片方は残してあげる、優しいでしょ？」=“Do you want the right eye or the left eye?　I'll leave the other one. Isn't that sweet?”
「そんなに胸が好き？　フッ、甘えん坊な証拠ね」=“Do you like my breasts that much?　You're a spoiled brat, aren't you?”
「貴方、胸を見ながら私と話す気？　随分偉くなったのね」=“Are you going to talk to me while looking at my breasts?　You've grown up a lot, haven't you?”
「胸を見に来ただけなら、一生写真集でも見ていなさい」=“If you're just here to look at my breasts, you should be looking at photo albums.”
「重大な事を見落として、何処を見ているの？　その目は飾り？」=“What are you looking at that's so important you can't see it?　Are those eyes for decoration?”
「この手は何？　私に差し出すという事でいいのかしら？」=“What's with the hand?　Are you sure you want me to do this?”
「何の意図かは知らないけれど、私の手に触れた。それだけで罪よ？」=“I don't know what your intentions are, but you touched my hand. Is that a crime?”
「そう、そんなに罰が欲しいのね。この変態マゾ豚は」=“Oh, so you want to be punished, do you? You perverted masochist pig.”
「ふぅん、貴方は最後の晩餐に、胸を選んだのね」=“Hmm, you've chosen breasts as your last supper.”
「きついお仕置きが必要なようね。はぁ、家畜の相手って面倒だわ」=“Sounds like you need a good spanking. Huh. Domestic animals are a pain in the ass.”
「しばらく手を使えなくしてあげる。家畜らしく、餌は口で食べなさい」=“I'm going to disable your hands for a while. You'll have to eat your food with your mouth like a domestic animal.”
「私を虚仮にしているの？　今すぐやめた方が身のためよ？」=“Are you pretending to be something you're not?　You'd do yourself a favor by not doing that right now, wouldn't you?”
「はぁ、私の優しい忠告を無視するなんて、貴方どうかしてるわ」=“Huh, you're out of your mind to ignore my friendly advice.”
「ハンマーを持ってきなさい。その手の骨、粉々にしてあげる」=“Bring me the hammer. Get the hammer. I'll break your hand into little pieces.”
「綺麗なものに触れたくなる気持ちはわかるわ。でも、私のトゲは痛いわよ？」=“I know what it's like to want to touch something beautiful. But my spikes hurt, don't they?”
「貴方の頬も出しなさい、擦り切れるまで撫で回してあげる」=“Give me your cheek and I'll stroke it until it's worn out.”
「やたらと頬を触ってくる豚を駆除するには、何が一番効果的かしら」=“What's the most effective way to get rid of a pig that keeps touching your cheek?”
「誰が私に近付いていいと言ったの？　下がりなさい」=“Who said you could come near me?　Back off.”
「貴方、苛めて楽しむ分には、なかなか面白い豚になってきたわね」=“You're becoming quite an interesting pig to torment, aren't you?”
「豚の繁殖方法にも興味が出てきたわ、少し話してみなさい」=“I'm also curious to know how you breed your pigs. Tell me about it.”
「で、他にもまだ何かあるの？　無いなら私は行くわよ？」=“So, is there anything else you'd like to tell me?　If not, I'll go, okay?”
「悩むだけ無駄よ。どうせつまらない話しかできないのだから」=“Don't bother. It's no use worrying about it, you've got nothing to talk about.”
「退屈は嫌いと言った筈よ。貴方、どこまで私を怒らせるつもり？」=“I told you I hate boredom. How much more are you going to piss me off?”
「貴方、不愉快ね。あまりにも愚か過ぎて、言葉を失うわ」=“You are disgusting. You're so stupid, I'm speechless.”
「私が相手をしてあげる価値をわかっていないようね。はぁ、これだから家畜は……」=“I don't think you understand the value of my companionship. Huh. That's why livestock are ...”
「貴方、ふざけてるの？　だとしたら随分命知らずね」=“Are you kidding me?　If you are, you're pretty fucking stupid.”
「だから？　家畜に好かれても、何も嬉しくないわね」=“So?　So what's so great about being liked by a domestic animal?”
「はぁ？　豚と交尾なんて、考えただけでもおぞましい事を言わないで」=“Huh?　Don't even think about mating with a pig, it's horrible.”
「[H名]さん、また性欲処理をお願いしたいんだけど？」=“Mr. [H名], can I ask you to do some more sex work for me?”
「まったく、本当にケモノのような性欲ね。まぁいいわ、手早く済ませてあげる」=“[H名], can I ask you to do it again? Oh, well, I'll make it quick.”
「調子に乗らないで。そんなに溜まっているなら、一人で惨めに処理しなさい」=“Don't get carried away. If you've got so much on your plate, why don't you go and do it yourself, miserably?”
「ふぅん、露出癖があるのね。いいわ、人としてのプライドを、ズタズタにしてあげる」=“Hmm, you have a tendency to expose yourself. Okay, I'll rip your pride to shreds.”
「吠えるな駄犬。祖チンを自分で擦って、勝手に処理してなさい」=“Stop barking, you little dog. Go rub your granddaddy's cock on yourself and take care of it yourself.”
「ンフッ、貴方の粗末なモノを苛めたくなってきたわ。ほら、早く出しなさい」=“I'm starting to feel the urge to torment your lousy cock. Come on, get it out.”
「いい子ね。たくさん泣かせて、私無しではいられなくしてあげるわ」=“Good girl. I'm going to make you cry so much, you won't be able to stand without me.”
「ん？　恥ずかしがっているの？　家畜の分際で、生意気ね」=“Hmm?　Are you embarrassed?　You're a shy little farm animal.”
「よかったらいっしょにお昼食べない？」=“Won't you grab lunch with me?”
「いいわよ。家畜がどれだけ貧相な食事をしているのか、少し興味があるわ」=“I don't care. I'm a little curious to see how poorly the livestock are fed.”
「いやよ。豚の餌を食べる趣味はないの」=“No. I have no taste for pig food.”
「は？　お断りよ。前から思っていたけど、何なのそれ？」=“What?　No, thank you. I've always wondered what that was all about.”
「そうやって貴方は、これからもチャンスを逃していくのでしょうね」=“I'm sure that's how you'll continue to miss out on opportunities.”
「一緒に帰らない？」=“Won't you walk home together with me?”
「あら、珍しくタイミングがいいじゃない。丁度荷物持ちが欲しかったの」=“Well, your timing is unusually good. I was just looking for a baggage handler.”
「嫌よ。豚と一緒に歩いていたら、飼い主だと思われるかもしれないもの」=“No. I don't want to be walking around with a pig that might think I'm its owner.”
「あの、[H名]さん。もしよかったら、デートしない？」=“Um, Mr. [H名]. Would you like to go out on a date?”
「しないわ。休日まで貴方の顔を見るなんて、考えられない」=“No, I don't. I can't imagine seeing your face on a holiday.”
「[H名]さん、俺とデートしてくださいっ！」=“Mr. [H名], you have to date me!”
「家畜とデートなんて、変な噂が立ったら面倒よ。続きは小声で話しなさい」=“I don't want to start any rumors about you dating a domestic animal. Keep your voice down.”
「はぁ、駄犬ほど吠えたがるというのは本当ね。勿論、答えはノーよ」=“Well, it's true what they say, the worse the dog, the more he barks. Of course, the answer is no.”
「貴方、休日の予定を空けておきなさい。この私と、デートさせてあげるわ」=“You better clear your schedule for the holidays. I'll give you a date with me.”
「よろしい。当日に遅刻なんてしたら、承知しないわよ？」=“Good. If you're late on the day of the date, I won't be happy.”
「へぇ、私に恥をかかせたわね……この事は、よく覚えておくわ」=“Well, you've embarrassed me... I'll keep that in mind.”
「却下ね。貴方、下心が丸見えだもの」=“Rejected. You're too obvious.”
「貴方の、コイカツ部、だっけ？　アレ、私も入ってあげるわ。感謝しなさい」=“Your Koikatsu club, right?　I'll join you. You should thank me.”
「何か勘違いしているようね。家畜の分際で、馴れ馴れしいのよ」=“You've got it all wrong. You're a domesticated animal and you're getting used to it.”
「貴方の顔を見ていると気分が悪くなるわ、消えてちょうだい」=“Your face makes me sick. I want you gone.”
「私の寛大さに感謝しなさい。本来なら二度と口を利かないところよ」=“You should be grateful for my generosity. I'm never going to speak to you again.”
「その大きくしたモノ、どうして欲しい？　叩く？　踏む？　どっち？」=“What do you want me to do with that big thing?　Hit it?　Step on it?　Which?”
「貴方、誰？　主に恥をかかせる下僕なんて知らないわ」=“Who are you?　I've never known a servant to humiliate his master.”
「ふふっ、面白い事を考えるわね。そんなに踏まれたいの？」=“Hmmm, that's an interesting thought. Do you really want to be stepped on?”
「主の汗の匂いに釣られて来たの？　フッ、救いようのない変態ね」=“Did you come here because of the smell of my sweat?　Oh, you irredeemable pervert.”
「あら、いいところに雑用係が来たわね。こき使ってあげるわ」=“Well, you've found your scullery maid. I'll put you to good use.”
「下僕がフラフラしていると、主まで暇だと思われるでしょう。ほら、こっちに来なさい」=“If the servant wanders around, the master will think he is bored. Come here, come here.”
「餌の時間よ。まさか、勝手に食べたりしていないでしょうね？」=“It's feeding time. I hope you're not eating without permission.”
「はぁ、少し疲れたわね。貴方、椅子になりなさい」=“Oh, I'm a little tired. Why don't you take a chair?”
「特にないわ、一つの事にこだわるのはリスクも伴うの、覚えておきなさい」=“Not really. Remember, sticking to one thing is a risk.”
「教えないわ、想像して今日も一人で慰めなさい。みっともなくね」=“I'm not going to tell you. You can console yourself today by imagining it. It's embarrassing.”
「はぁ、成長がないわね。これだけ話してきて、まだ私の事がわからないの？」=“Oh, you're not growing up. After all this talk, you still don't understand me?”
「周りをよく見なさい。今、私の一番近くにいるのは誰？　そういう事よ」=“Take a look around you. Who is the person closest to me right now?　That's what I'm talking about.”
「待たないわ。仮定の話だとしても腹立たしいわね。少し叩かせなさい」=“I won't wait. I don't want to wait. It's annoying, even if it is hypothetical. Let me hit him a little.”
「そうね。栄養剤を注射して、叩いて気合を入れてやれば、すぐ治るでしょ」=“Yes. I'll give him a shot of nutritional supplements, give him a good beating and he'll be fine in no time.”
「可能性はゼロではないわ。身分違いの恋なんて、よく語られる事でしょう」=“There is no chance. It's not impossible. People talk about love between people of different status.”
「えぇ、そうね。生理の時は全て任せるわ、私のために良く働きなさい」=“Yeah, I know. I'll take care of everything when you're on your period. You work hard for me.”
「くだらない質問ね。どうであろうと、毎日私に尽くすのが貴方の役目よ」=“That's a stupid question. You're supposed to serve me every day, no matter what.”
「感じるわよ。そうだ、貴方も感じる事ができように、開発してあげましょうか」=“I can feel it. Yes, I'm going to develop you to be able to feel.”
「アナルで感じてはいけないの？　狭い常識に捕らわれると損よ」=“Why can't I feel anal?　It's not a good idea to be so narrow-minded.”
「私ね、男のアナルを開発してみたかったのよ。フフッ、楽しみだわ」=“I've always wanted to try anal sex with a man. I'm looking forward to it.”
「そういう所だし、下手で粗末なモノでも、多少は感じてしまうでしょうね」=“That's where it's at, and I'm sure you'll feel some of it, even if it's crude and inferior.”
「ふぅん、尿道を開発されたいという事ね？　わかったわ、準備しましょう」=“Hmm, you mean you want to have your urethra developed?　All right, let's get you ready.”
「まぁ、誰に何を言われようが、変えるつもりなんてないけどね」=“Well, I don't care what anyone says, I'm not going to change my mind.”
「フッ、そう。少し下品かと思っていたけど、下品な貴方には丁度いいのね」=“Hmm, yes. I thought it was a little vulgar, but you're just the right kind of vulgar.”
「やはり見下されるのが好きなの？　マゾ豚なところは変わらないわね」=“Do you like to be looked down upon?　You're still a masochistic pig, aren't you?”
「まぁ、触れ合うなら肉感があった方がいいものね。そこは理解できるわ」=“Well, if you're going to be touching someone, you might as well have some flesh on you. I can understand that.”
「じゃあ、この体型を維持するために、貴方には色々と付き合ってもらうわ」=“Well, you're going to have to go through a lot of trouble to maintain this figure.”
「貴方のご主人様はお怒りよ。どうしたらいいか、わかるわね？」=“Your master is angry. Do you know what to do?”
「はぁ、私も甘くなったわね。以前なら百回は踏みつけていたところよ」=“Oh, I've become so naive. I'd have stomped on you a hundred times before.”
「謝るのは基本よ、でも謝るだけではダメ。もっと誠意を見せなさい」=“Apologizing is basic, but apologizing is not enough. You have to show more sincerity.”
「なぁに？　苛めて欲しい？」=“What do you want?　Do you want me to torment you?”
「顔色なんて窺わなくても、私の事をわかるようになりなさい」=“You don't have to look at me like that. You have to understand me.”
「貴方の顔、見飽きたわね。ちょっと叩いて、形を変えてみましょうか」=“I'm tired of looking at your face. I'm tired of looking at your face. I'm going to slap it and reshape it.”
「主の胸にいやらしい視線を向けるなんて、まさかないわよね～？」=“You're not going to look at my breasts like that, are you?”
「そんなに胸が好きなら、貴方の胸も腫れあがるくらいに叩いてあげましょうか？」=“If you like breasts so much, why don't I give yours a good beating to make them swell up?”
「ほら、揉んでみる？　なんて……言うと思ったの？　ゴミクズ」=“Do you want me to rub them?　What did you think I was going to say ...?　Garbage.”
「私の目を見なさい。さぁ、後はわかるわね？」=“Look me in the eye. Now you know the rest, don't you?”
「ん？　違うでしょ？　ほら、お手。どうしたの？　早くしなさい」=“Hmm?　Don't you?　Here, your hand. What's the matter?　Come on.”
「飼い犬に手を噛まれるって、こういう気分なのかしら……」=“I wonder what it's like to have your dog bite your hand...”
「はぁ、この駄犬……待て、伏せ。いい？　少しの間、餌は抜きよ」=“Huh, you spoiled dog... Wait, get down. Okay?　No food for a little while.”
「フフッ、良い度胸ね。胸だけに？　なんて、笑い話で済むと思った？」=“You've got some nerve. Breasts?　Did you really think that was going to be funny?”
「主の体、それも胸に勝手に触るなんて……度し難い蛮行ね」=“Touching the Lord's body, let alone his breasts, is ... unconscionable.”
「貴方のような輩を、おっぱい星人と言うそうよ。星ごと滅びなさい」=“They call people like you titty aliens. They call you tits aliens.”
「頭を撫でられて、私が喜ぶと思った？　フフッ、逆よ、気持ち悪いわ」=“Did you think I'd be happy to have my head stroked?　No, it's not. It's disgusting.”
「気安いのは相変わらずね。私は直せと何度も言っているわよ？」=“You're still so easygoing. I keep telling you to fix it, don't I?”
「下僕から家畜に戻りたいの？　いいかげんにしなさい」=“Do you want to go from being a servant to a domestic?　That's enough.”
「ふぅん、わかった。手を噛み千切って欲しいという事ね？」=“Hmm, okay. You want me to bite your hand off, don't you?”
